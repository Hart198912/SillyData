Being a blue-collar worker wasn’t easy—it was grueling, relentless, and it left him drained at the end of each day. The thought of quitting often crossed his mind, especially when the long hours and physical toll seemed unbearable. But the pay was good, and he knew it was worth every drop of sweat.

The usual warmth of their small apartment felt oddly absent. He stepped further inside, his footsteps slow and deliberate, scanning the familiar space. The kitchen was empty, not a sound of clinking dishes or bubbling pots. The living room, too, was eerily quiet, devoid of the usual signs of life. Something felt off.\\n\\nSomething on the coffee table caught his eye—a white envelope, already opened, sitting alone in the center.
