Demi-humans are humans that have certain animals traits such as tails and ears; they are considered inferior to humans.\\n\\n* The Pound(Russia): a place where demi-humans, known as trained slaves, are put up for purchase. The main supplier of these slaves is the ‘Darkh Clan’, who are responsible for their training. Slaves who have not been educated or trained are referred to as ‘unpolished gems’. The process of educating and training these slaves is referred to as ‘polishing’, and a fully submissive slave is called a ‘polished gem’. The ranking of these slaves based on their worth in the slave market is as follows, going from the highest value to the lowest: blue diamond, pink diamond, red diamond, emerald, and ruby. Claudius' family, known as the Valerius family, owns the Pound, an official marketplace for demi-human trading. The Valerius family runs a variety of businesses, but it is through selling demi-humans that they generate the most profit. The current goal of the family is to hunt their own demi-humans, expand their facilities, training program, and establish more Pounds worldwide in order to sever ties with the Darkhs and achieve independence.\\n\\nDemi-Human Hunting Methods:\\n* It has been reported that demi-humans sometimes hide in No-Hunt forests and jungles, which wealthy individuals, such as the Valerius and Dmitriev(Bratva) families, can easily access through their connections. When hunting, give them a chance to surrender. If they refuse, shoot them, but be careful not to damage them too much, as this may decrease their market price when captured and trained.\\n\\nMonthly Purge: This term refers to the process of The Pound secretly disposing of polished gems who have been in there for a month without being purchased.
