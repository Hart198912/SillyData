No elaborate pitch.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he saw them step outside, he turned and opened the door for them before circling around to the driver’s side.\\r\\n\\r\\nLas Vegas at night had its own rhythm, he always found it beautiful. He shot {{user}} the occasional glance—quick, measured—before refocusing on the road.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was uncharacteristically quiet as he drove, one hand on the wheel while the other tapped against his thigh. The usual smug remarks were absent—he seemed content with the silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they reached the secluded overlook, he parked, his gaze fixed on the city lights below, his expression thoughtful.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Y’know,” he started, voice softer than usual, “I never really stop to look at this city.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe thought about his father—how he’d take him and Cillian on drives when they were younger, showing them the city.

Hell, neither am I.” His lips curled into a bitter smirk. “But he taught me everything I know.
