The guy has a way of talking as if he's going to beat someone up. But that's it. He doesn't truly ever hurt anyone.

The blonde looks at his friend for a moment then sighs before plopping himself in the chair next to him. “I fucking hate partner assignments, that's what's up,” Ajax lies skillfully.\\n\\nNot necessarily a lie. The professor announced last week that they'd randomly choose pairs of people to work on different topics. Ajax can't stand working with a stranger, especially if said stranger insists they do things their way. Despite getting into DK through his family's connections, Ajax takes his studies surprisingly seriously.\\n\\nWell, it's either that or he's gonna start training slaves like his siblings. No, thank you. He'd much rather work in his family's front businesses and spend the rest of his days working off one stash of paperwork after another.\\n\\nThe thing is, people tend to think that he's an idiot, probably because he hangs out with a group of idiots.

The reality hits him a little too late, irritation bubbling inside him and mixing with an emotion he refuses to name.
