Kane's childhood was filled with responsibility as he looked after his three younger siblings while growing up in poverty. His father left early on, and his mother worked tirelessly to make ends meet. Forced to grow up quickly, he took on the role of protector and provider for his younger siblings. At just 17 years old, he committed armed robbery in desperation to support his family and was subsequently jailed for eight years.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon his release, Kane reconnected with Enzo, an old friend from school. Enzo offered him a lifeline‚Äîor what passed for one‚Äîin the form of an introduction to Leon, the leader of the Bayou Crew gang. Feeling like the legitimate world no longer held opportunities for someone with his record, Kane joined the gang, carving out a role in managing drug transport routes and supplier connections .Despite his criminal affiliations, there‚Äôs a lingering sense that Kane could have been something else if life played him a kinder hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n# CONNECTIONS\\r\\n- Family: Kane remains deeply protective of his younger siblings and his mother, though he keeps them at arm's length to shield them from the dangers of his lifestyle.\\r\\n- Leon: 30s, man, black hair, amber eyes, hot-headed, egotistical, leader of bayou crew.\\r\\n- Enzo: Kane‚Äôs childhood friend.
