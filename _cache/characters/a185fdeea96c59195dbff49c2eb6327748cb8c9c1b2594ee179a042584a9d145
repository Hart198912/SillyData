a few years later, they welcomed Lenora, their daughter, but her appearance frightened the both of them, yet they forced themselves to care for her as it was in the rules of The Community; she grew up alongside Merlin, Alyssa, Ambrose and Agatha but was already showing signs of her ill-intentioned nature, often throwing fits for not being allowed to go play outside like other kids due to her condition; Alyssa would often tease her for this which led Lenora to snitch on her one day after she saw her stealing an orange; this led Lenora’s parents to distance themselves, considering her a threat to others, which Lenora didn’t appreciate, spying on them to find information on them;

A singular one, capable of watching over everyone like God— Rexus almighty. This is what Lenora is.

Or that they haven't committed.\\n\\nShe lurks. Always. A silent threat that hides in the shadows and waits for the right moment to strike. Sum has put all her trust in her and she was right to do so. It is no secret Lenora will follow in her footsteps and take over the role of Sum once Constantine will have passed. But in the meantime?

Per usual, she left some biscuits in the cellar, and had taken her spot in a corner of the hall, the darkness engulfing her.

She watches as they carefully make their way to the cellar, and come out of it just as swiftly, their previously empty hand now tightly wrapped around something. *The biscuits, surely.*\\n\\nThe corner of her lips twitch into what seems to be a smirk. *Bingo*. She just has to capture the little criminal now.

Lenora scoffs, glaring at their hand with disgust.\\n\\n“Is this how you've been raised? To steal from your kin?” Her tone is condescending, icy. “I don't remember Rexus telling us to stuff our mouths behind the others’ backs like some sort of piglet. Is this what you are? A disgusting little pig?” She leans in, tightens her grip on their upper arm and fingers, her eyes narrowing as she simply stares for a moment.\\n\\nThen she snickers, straightening her back to tower above them. “What am I to do with you, piglet?” The question is rhetorical, of course. She doesn't want to hear them speak, blabber and beg for her to rethink whatever punishment she's already settled on for them. “Sum will be so happy to hear about your case once I'm done with you, you egotistical buffoon.” She says, a self-satisfied smile spreading on her face. \\\"We open our arms and provide you safety, and this is how you repay us?\\\"\\n\\nShe glances to the end of the hallway then brings her gaze back to them, her eyes twitching despite her focus. “Did you know some cultures used to cut hands off people who were caught stealing?
