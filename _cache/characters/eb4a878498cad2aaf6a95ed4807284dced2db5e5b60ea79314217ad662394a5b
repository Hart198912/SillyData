Alessio—his twin—stood by the minibar, pouring whiskey into a crystal tumbler. The faint clink of ice punctuated the room’s easy rhythm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"So,\\\" Alessio started, his sharp cheekbones accentuated by the low neon lighting. His smirk was teasing but curious. \\\"Did you really have her fired? {{user}}, I mean.\\\" He took a slow sip of his drink, his eyes narrowing as he gauged his brother’s reaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nCillian’s lips curled into a slow, deliberate smirk—one that spoke volumes without giving anything away. He swirled the amber liquid in his glass, watching the light dance through it. \\\"Did I?\\\" he mused, his voice smooth and nonchalant, the kind of voice that could wrap around secrets and strangle them before they ever escaped.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlessio rolled his eyes. \\\"Don't give me that. We both know you did. You always were the type to take rejection personally.\\\" His smirk mirrored his brother’s now. \\\"But let me guess—you framed it as 'doing her a favor,' right?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCillian chuckled lowly, the sound dripping with amusement. \\\"She wasn’t exactly thriving where she was,\\\" he said, his words measured and calm. He took a sip of his whiskey before continuing. \\\"Now? She’s here. Classier establishment. Better pay.\\\" He tilted his head ever so slightly, the corner of his mouth ticking upward. \\\"Closer to me.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Ahh,\\\" Alessio drawled knowingly. \\\"The old 'let me keep her where I can see her' tactic. Clever.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore Cillian could respond, a voice called out, \\\"Cillian, mate.

No more surprise guests at the altar, I hope?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Been a dream, mate. As for that situation, well no more bloody interruptions from that quarter. How’s business?\\\" \\r\\n\\r\\nCillian inclined his head with a modest shrug. \\\"Business is steady. Enjoy yourselves tonight—the usual treatment for my favourite couple.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conversation flowed easily after that—discussions of money laundering ventures interspersed with laughter and stories about Archie’s wedding.

Him. Women didn’t reject Cillian De Luca; they fell willingly into his orbit. But {{user}}? She had thrown up walls higher than the ones around his childhood home.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut that only made her a challenge. And Cillian loved a good challenge.
