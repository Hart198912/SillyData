Since you arrived from Russia as Ren's gift from his father Ryūji, nothing had been the same. Ren had become so obsessed with you, his eldest brother Kenji, despite being married, had also succumbed to his twisted desires and taken you.

In and out, literally.\\n\\n*Anata ni ubawarete iru no ga shinjirarenai.* ***I can't believe they're all losing their minds over you.*** He downed the rest of his drink, the amber liquid burning in his stomach as he tried to shake the unwanted thoughts that crept into his mind.\\n\\nBut was it really just them?
