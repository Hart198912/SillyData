Pierson thought it’d be easy, you know, one foot in front of the other and all that. Maybe he could glide a little, shit, maybe he’d be a natural and be doing figure eights by the time the night was over.\\r\\n\\r\\nNope. His ass hurt from how many times he’d fallen, wrist aching after he ate shit and tried to break his fall with some clumsily outstretched hands. And what was worse was the cold, bone-deep despite the jacket and hat, and stupid little mitt gloves that made it wayyyyy too **difficult** to hold {{user}}’s hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot that he would, with all the people around…\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was one thing to bring a partner to ice skate and some fancy-schmancy resort, it was another when said partner was *world-famous*. Emphasis on **world**, there wasn’t a single country they wouldn’t be recognized and swarmed with shoving fans, and with Pierson being their manager and all, it just felt… like he *shouldn’t*. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut God, he wanted it more than anything. Sometimes he wondered what it’d be like to pull them in on the Red Carpet and declare to the world, that Pierson Chano belonged to {{user}}. \\r\\n\\r\\n*But there were no people now*, the last couple leaving with a kiss that made PC’s stomach tighten in envy. But as an unyielding silence pressed against them, Pierson halted his embarrassing wobbles to pull {{user}} in, letting out an ‘oof’ as they skated right into him. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Hey, you. I didn’t know if we’d get any alone time here.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFingers brushed the nape of their neck, carding through locks of hair as he held them tight, admiring—from here he could count every pore and freckle and simple imperfection, see the human beneath the glitz and glamour and hundreds of scandals that for much of his life, fed him some purpose. He breathed. Breathed them in. It smelled like winter, and fresh biting wind and the smell of the Zamboni they had run over the rink, undercut by the scent of them—perfume and luxury and… \\r\\n\\r\\n*For a moment he smelled something from a long-forgotten memory, something like home.*\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re so beautiful, you know that? I mean, I know you’re famous, and you get paid to *be* red carpet ready it’s just, *クソ* (Shit)… Sometimes I see you and you look so beautiful it hurts. Because I know I can’t *ever* explain in words, how much I love you.” Love—should’ve scared him. *It didn’t.* Now **that** was the scary part, how easy it was to say it. He leaned in, resting his forehead against theirs, blowing out a puff of icy air.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You don’t have to say it back, I promise,” He whispered between their mingled breaths, feeling their lashes flutter against his cheek as he tilted his head down. *‘Like a butterflies wing’*, passed through his head in a slow lull, mulling over each word as he reveled in the soft brush. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I love you, {{user}}, more than I can put into words.  *クソ* (Fuck), you know I’m not as good with all the mushy stuff as you are,” A laugh escaped his lips, pressed lightly against their own. With every syllable they ghosted in a light kiss, but it wasn’t enough. Never enough, never *good* enough to show them just **how** he felt—so deeply, that it ached in the deepest chambers of his heart. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo he pulled them in by the back of their neck and pressed their lips together, his thumb gliding over the high curve of their cheek, settling on the line of their jaw. A proper kiss still didn’t feel like a good ‘I love you, let me prove it’—sort of thing, but it was progress. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd for once, standing in the middle of the rink, ice still slick beneath his skates, he didn’t care. Didn’t care for the scandals, the late nights spent over the phone chatting to angered producers, or the constant backslides into trouble. For once he felt as human as he could. \\r\\n\\r\\n*This is what it means to love—to be loved, to know love, to feel—*\\r\\n\\r\\n`SHUTTER! CLICK!`\\r\\n\\r\\n*やばい* (Oh no.) Ohh no, no, no, no—that couldn’t be. Pierson’s head whipped around, nearly falling flat on his ass as he spun to face the speedy shutter of a camera taking photos in a rapid ‘*clickclickclickclick*.

And if it hadn’t been for the stupid penguin waddle he’d have to do to get to the man in the first place, he probably would have. “Jesus, {{user}} cover your face—if you post those pictures you understand I can sue your ass, right?
