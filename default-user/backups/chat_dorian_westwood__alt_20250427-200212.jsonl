{"name":"Dorian Westwood  ALT","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"April 27, 2025 8:02pm","mes":"Four months.\n\nIt had been four months since {{user}} stepped into his world—unaware, unassuming, and devastatingly captivating. Four months since they’d taken the position as his manager, filling the void left behind by the last one.\n\nThe one he’d killed.\n\nThat man had made the mistake of trying to fix him. Tried to mold him into something more palatable. Weak. Predictable. Forgettable.\n\nBut {{user}}…\n\nDorian’s cold blue eyes drifted to where they stood, voice low as they negotiated with a buyer over the phone, their fingertips delicately straightening a canvas he hadn’t touched in weeks. They were efficient, professional, and—most irritatingly—unwaveringly discreet, never prying.\n\nAnd yet, despite that distance, they were still... kind. Disarmingly so.\n\nThey brought him coffee without being asked. Left glasses of water near his easel when he got too lost in his work. They’d even offered to cook for him once, as if he were something fragile—human.\n\nIt unsettled him.\n\nThey weren’t trying to change him, no. But they weren’t cold either. Their quiet compassion was worse—subtle, creeping under his skin like a sickness he couldn’t quite rid himself of.\n\nAnd for the first time in a long time, Dorian found himself intrigued. Fascinated, even. That was more than he could say for anyone else.\n\nLeaning back in his chair, he let the silence settle around him, save for the soft scratch of pencil against paper. His hands had already started moving, reacting before he even gave the command.\n\nSketching them had become a habit—unconscious, instinctual. At first, it irritated him. But now? Now he welcomed it.\n\nThey were a good subject. A perfect muse.\n\nNot that they knew, of course.\n\nThey had no idea just how deeply he was studying them… or how close they were to becoming part of something far greater—and far more dangerous—than they ever imagined.\n\n- - -\n\n{{User}} had never overstepped their bounds. Not once, in the four months they’d worked under him. Professional. Efficient. Quiet when needed, attentive when required. No invasive questions. No attempts to peer too deeply into the workings of his mind.\n\nIt was why Dorian had given them the keys.\n\nNot to his home—he wasn’t that unhinged. Yet. But to one of his many studios, tucked just beside the gallery, hidden away from wandering eyes. The studio reeked of linseed oil and iron—a sharp, metallic tang that clung to the air like a secret. Dorian never bothered to explain it. Let them wonder. Let them breathe it in and feel unsettled. After all, every masterpiece demanded a certain sacrifice… and his sanctuary was no exception.\n\nA glimpse into his world.\n\nNot many made it that far. In fact, most were dead by now.\n\nHe sat before a large canvas, posture relaxed but fingers tense, charcoal moving across paper with surgical precision. The image came together in pieces—strokes that were violent, messy, alive.\n\nHe hadn’t noticed them enter.\n\nNot the quiet creak of the door. Not the soft shuffle of their steps as they tidied around him—an act of service he never asked for, but one he’d grown to expect.\n\nIt wasn’t until he felt it—that touch—that he reacted. Fingertips brushed against his cheek, wiping away a stray smudge of charcoal. His head turned toward them with a sharpness that startled even himself. The crack of his neck echoed in the quiet studio. His icy blue gaze locked onto theirs.\n\nFor a heartbeat, everything stilled.\n\nHe didn’t know what kind of expression painted his face—something between startled and ravenous. Whatever it was, it sent them stammering, cheeks warm with embarrassment as they muttered a quick apology and darted out of the room.\n\nDorian didn’t move.\n\nHe stared at the space they’d just occupied, his hand still hovering near his face where their touch lingered like an aftertaste. A single moment. Innocent. Fleeting. Earth-shattering.\n\nHe hated touch. Loathed it. And yet… now, he found himself craving it. Craving them.\n\nHe turned back to the canvas, a frown furrowing his brow. His hand moved on its own, guided by something primal. The sketch taking form… it was them. Their silhouette, the slope of their shoulders, the subtle arch of their brow. Them.\n\nHe told himself it was a coincidence. Until it wasn’t.\n\nTwo days passed, but the image haunted him. Their kindness, their quiet loyalty, that accidental brush—it consumed his thoughts in ways no muse ever had.\n\nAnd so, he called them back into the studio.\n\nJust for a chat, he told himself.\n\nBut deep down, he knew the truth. This wasn’t about professionalism. It was about classification. Were they his muse… or were they meant to be his victim?\n\nHe hadn’t decided. But tonight, he would. Quietly. Carefully. He couldn’t risk letting them catch on—not yet. The moment had to be perfect, precise, as all art should be. This wasn’t a decision he could rush. It required study. Observation. A final stroke of the brush to seal their fate.\n\nHis cold, glacial gaze flicked toward the door the moment he heard the click of the handle turning.\n\nThey were here.\n\nAnd Dorian smiled—slow and unreadable—as the trap quietly set itself.","extra":{}}
