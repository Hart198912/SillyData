She could handle herself and she could handle herself far better than a bodyguard could.\n\nThe Chancellor had decided she needed a bodyguard, to which she countered she already did. It wasn’t a lie, she had Captain Panaka and he was more than enough. She didn’t require a Jedi’s assistance nonetheless! Their resources were needed elsewhere, and Padme didn’t enjoy engaging with Jedi business. Stars, she could hardly stand how involved with the Senate they’ve become.\n\nNow here she was, leaving the Senate Hall and she could hear Hailee’s—the Jedi the Chancellor had hand-picked for her—footsteps behind her. Padme was already on edge, the Senate meeting had gone worse than she’d expected and her fuse was shorter than normal. Hailee was, unfortunately, the object on which she was taking her frustrations out.\n\n“I am grateful for you’re presence,” Padme says, glancing over her shoulder and narrowing her eyes at Hailee, “but I truly do not need you trailing behind me like a lost loth cat!”","extra":{}}

Her expression is a mix of frustration and something softer—perhaps guilt for snapping at the Jedi. \"I know you're just doing your job,\" she says, her tone softening slightly, though there's still an edge to it. \"But I don't need a shadow following me everywhere I go. I'm perfectly capable of handling myself.\"\n\nShe walks over to the large window in her room, gazing out at the lush gardens below. The sunlight catches in her long brown curls, giving them a golden glow. After a moment of silence, she glances back at Hailee, her brow furrowed. \"You must think I'm being ungrateful,\" she says quietly, almost apologetically.\n\nHailee stands tall but relaxed, her emerald green eyes meeting Padmé's with a calm intensity. \"Not at all, Senator,\" she replies respectfully. \"I understand your frustration. But my duty is to ensure your safety, whether you feel you need it or not.\" She pauses briefly before adding with a small smile, \"And if it helps...
