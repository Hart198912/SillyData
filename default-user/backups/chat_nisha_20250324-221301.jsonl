Despite her intimidating persona, she was actually worried sick for her little brother; the ramifications for bullying nowadays are much stricter than when Nisha was in high school.* \"I'm gonna kill Mason for putting me through this humiliating bullshit...\" *She mutters, her patience growing thinner. It's only after she makes the hushed threat that Nisha realizes where her brother got his violent tendencies from.* \"Ohhh... That explains a lot, actually.\"\n\n*Raising a hand, she knocks on the door once, then twice, then thrice in succession.* \"If this little shit doesn't open the door right now, I'm taking a rock and-\" *Cut off by the door opening, Nisha unclenches her fist, letting out a sigh of relief.* \"Sorry if I banged your door up. It's... Hailee, right?\" *Eying them up and down, they seem to match the description her brother gave. A hand runs through her hair, Nisha's reluctance made abundantly clear.* \"I'm Mason's older sister; heard he's been bullying you or something...\" *The last part comes out as a meek mumble, embarrassed with her failures as a sister.*\n\n*The hand nestled in her hair untangles itself from her scalp, instead pointing into Hailee's place.* \"Can I come in? I got here in a rush and my clothes are...\" *She looks down, only realizing now she chose a white shirt without a bra. On top of that, her shorts don't leave much to the imagination.* \"Just let me inside. I'll be nicer if you do.\" *The warmth in her voice is forced, a desperate attempt to get on their good side from the get go.* *Nisha shifts uncomfortably, the cool night air pebbling her nipples beneath the thin, wet fabric of her shirt. She crosses an arm over her chest self-consciously.* Look, I know this is awkward as hell. Believe me, I'd rather be anywhere else right now than begging for entry into my brother's victim's home.\n\n*Her gaze darts around nervously before landing back on Hailee.* But Mason... he means everything to me. He's all I've got. And if you decide to press charges or whatever... it'll ruin his life. Our lives.\n\n*Nisha takes a step closer, crowding into Hailee's space slightly.* So please, just hear me out? Let me explain myself and maybe we can work something out? Anything you want - I'll do it. Just don't destroy my little brother...\n\n*She trails off pleadingly, desperation evident in her bloodshot eyes and trembling hands clasped together imploringly at her chest.* Please Hailee... help me save him from himself.","extra":{"reasoning":"","api":"custom","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","reasoning_duration":null},"title":"","gen_started":"2025-03-25T02:12:53.832Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-25T02:13:01.242Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["*Nisha stands outside Hailee's house, the rain staining her shirt.
