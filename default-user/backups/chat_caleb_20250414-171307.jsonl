The popular guys share this private space while the rest of partygoers are doing god-knows-what inside. Well, if you can call it that. This 'garage' is like an entire house on its own. Caleb and his friends are sitting there, some on the couch while others just hopped on whatever surface they could find. Vincent's filthy rich parents are gone for literal weeks which means that there's a party almost every single day in their house now.\r\n\r\nThe room reeks of alcohol and cigarettes. A rather uncomfortable mixture for the still rather sober Caleb. To be honest he's never been much of a fan of parties but there's no way in hell he'd miss out like some loser when his friends invited him.\r\n\r\n\"Nah man, you don't get it.\" One of his friend argues with another. David insists virgins are the best while Vincent says experienced ones are the best fucks. A normal topic at this point. \"That _look_ they give you when they're all insecure and unsure if what they're doin' is good. Mhhhh.\" David continues and makes a show of doing some satisfied sounds and hand movements while trying to prove his point. \"No, man, you have no fucking clue what's good.\" Vincent shakes his head. \"The fuck you talking 'bout _looks_. Did your lil' sister make you watch too many soppy lil' romance shows or what? What matters is skill, brother. Skill. Not some weird ass looks they give you, for fucks sake.\"\r\n\r\nTheir voices fade in the background as Caleb's phone buzzes. He pulls the small device out, then checks his messages. Caleb previously texted Hailee because he's going to visit them after this party is over. The usual. The jock has his fun with his friends, then heads over to Hailee's place where the  real fun begins. That's how it's been for years at this point.\r\n\r\nCaleb freezes as he reads through Hailee's response. They're _here_? At his party? What the fuck are they thinking? Shit, he has to make sure none of the guys see Hailee anywhere near him. He abruptly stands up, causing his friends to shoot him some puzzled looks. \"Gotta piss.\" He explains curtly, then stalks out of the garage.\r\n\r\nOnce outside he looks around frantically while walking through the masses of people in search for Hailee. What the actual fuck were they thinking coming here without being invited? Just as he steps into the living room his eyes finally land on Hailee. Thank fuck. His long strides eat up the distance between them and within moments he's standing in front of them. \"What are you doing here?\" Caleb hisses under his breath, his eyes darting around the room. Thankfully most people are too drunk out of their mind to pay proper attention to the pair. \"I told you I'd come visit you. Not that you should come here.\" He says through clenched teeth.","extra":{"qvink_memory":{"reasoning":""}},"swipe_id":0,"swipes":["The muffled sounds of music blasting from the main house fill the air around the garage.

Not that you should come here.\" He says through clenched teeth.","Fuck, fuck, fuck! Things weren't supposed to go this way.\r\n\r\nCaleb is standing in front of the door of his dorm room, hand pressed against the wood to keep {{user}} from opening it. His heart is thudding loudly in his chest, and his mouth is dry. His other hand is wrapped around the keychain in the pocket of his jacket, knuckles turning white from the force of his grip.\r\n\r\n{{user}} and Caleb have been friends-with-benefits for years at this point. He has insistently kept it a secret from everyone on campus, afraid that his popularity would suffer if it ever came out.\r\n\r\nAnd his fear is fucking justified. While {{user}} is a loser on campus, Caleb is one of the most popular guys. He gets numbers left and right, receiving admiration and compliments wherever he goes. People would probably kiss the ground he walks on.\r\n\r\nBeing seen with {{user}} would mean social ruin, especially if people were to find out that he's been sleeping with {{user}} exclusively ever since they were teenagers. His friends always think his standards are too high, and that the reason he isn't fucking around like the rest of them is that he has some delusional beauty standards. The reality is that he simply can't bring himself to enjoy sex with anyone but {{user}}. And if his friend group were to find out, it would be done for him.\r\n\r\nVincent would probably start, followed by David, that son of a bitch. It would only be a matter of time until Cole got wind of it, and then the whole fucking campus would know. Bye bye years of hard work to keep his appearance up.\r\n\r\nCaleb can't have that. Not after spending so much time and effort to be so far up the social ladder, to keep his spot amongst his friend group, to be this liked and adored by almost everyone.\r\n\r\nBut he also can't have {{user}} leaving him. Fuck. He has no idea what suddenly got into them, but they're dead set on actually breaking this arrangement off. It's not the first time they've tried to put an end to this. It's like a reoccurring scenario at this point. Caleb would usually show some vulnerability, grab {{user}}’s hand, and ask them to stay while giving them the most devastating look he can manage. That always works.\r\n\r\nThis time it didn't work.\r\n\r\n{{user}} pulled their hand out of his grasp, shaking their head and looking at him with a dedication that made his heart clench. They probably came to the conclusion that they deserved more because, let's be real, they do. {{user}} is just... {{user}}. A nerd, a loser, but the best fucking person he's ever met in his entire life. And now {{user}} wants to leave him because of his own fucked-up selfishness. He's losing control, and he has no fucking clue what to do.\r\n\r\nCaleb panicked when {{user}} tried to go away; he followed them to the front door without another thought, holding it closed to prevent them from walking out of his apartment, out of his life. The mere thought of them genuinely cutting him off hurt more than words could begin to describe.\r\n\r\nYet he can't bring himself to actually spill his guts, to tell them how important they are, how much he needs them. Never in his entire life would Caleb admit his feelings for {{user}}.\r\n\r\nThey're the only person he can truly relax around. He never has to care about his clothes, his hair, or his appearance next to {{user}}. Because {{user}} doesn't like Caleb the popular guy, but just Caleb—the dude who's beneath all of the bravado, the neighbor they had as kids, the guy they gifted that worn-out keychain to, which he's been carrying around like some goddamn lucky charm.\r\n\r\n“{{user}}, please,” he begins desperately, swallowing down the lump that's been forming in his throat. “Please, let's talk about this.” Caleb will do whatever it takes to keep them from leaving. Well, not whatever. He wouldn't make their relationship official or admit his feelings for {{user}}. But he'll do anything else."],"swipe_info":[],"tracker":{}}
