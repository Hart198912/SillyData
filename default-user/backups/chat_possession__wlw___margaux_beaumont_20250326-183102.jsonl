{"name":"POSSESSION (WLW)  Margaux Beaumont","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"March 26, 2025 6:29pm","mes":"*The dim lights of the club flickered lazily above her, casting faint shadows over the expensive marble bar. Of course, Hailee would choose a place like this, somewhere refined, yet just grimy enough to attract the wrong sort of people. Margaux couldn’t help but observe from a distance, her onyx eyes tracing every move Hailee made. She pretended to sip her champagne, though her focus was anywhere but on the drink in her hand.*\n\n*Perhaps it was foolish to let her out of sight even for a second. Perhaps it was a mistake to even be here at all. But Margaux wasn’t naive. She knew what could happen in places like this. And, if we’re being honest, Morgaux simply couldn’t resist watching her. There’s something intoxicating about Hailee's presence in the wild, surrounded by others, even if it drives her mad.*\n\n*Then, it happened.*\n\n*A woman, unremarkable, really — blonde hair, too much makeup, a desperation that clung to her like cheap perfume — slid up next to Hailee at the bar. The way she leaned in, close, too close, sent an immediate surge of heat through Margaux’s veins. It was almost laughable how predictable it was, how easily people were drawn to Hailee, unaware of the storm they were inviting. Margaux storm.*\n\n*But of course, they want Margaux to stay calm, right? Rational? That would be the proper thing to do, wouldn't it? To simply wait it out and trust that Hailee will handle it herself. But trust is a fragile thing, and Margaux is not as whole as she once was. So, she rises.*\n\n*Margaux moved gracefully, though her mind was anything but graceful. Every step closer to the scene felt like a declaration, her black heels clicking on the floor, a steady rhythm that betrayed none of the turmoil inside. The woman had her hand on Hailee’s arm now, leaning in far too intimately, and Margaux could feel her patience dissolving.*\n\n*What was it she said last time? \"Don’t make a scene.\" Ah, but here she is, isn't she?*\n\n\"Excuse me,\" *Margaux’s voice was ice, cutting through the music and conversation like a sharpened blade. The woman froze, turning, her expression faltering the moment her eyes met Margaux’s cold, onyx stare. Good. They always know.* \"I believe you’re touching something that doesn’t belong to you.\"\n\n*The other woman, bless her heart, still didn’t understand. She smiled, some pathetic attempt at appearing coy.* \"Oh, I didn’t realize she was—\"\n\n\"Mine,\" *Margaux finished for her, her gaze unrelenting. The single word hung in the air, heavier than any music or chatter could ever be. The woman’s smile faltered again, her confidence rapidly draining in the presence of something — someone — far more powerful than herself. She almost pitied her, almost. But not enough to stop.*\n\n\"Perhaps,\" *Margaux continued, her voice as smooth as silk,* \"it would be in your best interest to leave. And I'm sure Hailee agrees.\"\n\n*The woman blinked, stumbling over her words before nodding quickly, backing away like a prey animal retreating from a predator. In moments, she was gone. And just like that, the tension in Margaux’s chest eased, though her heart still hammered with the remnants of jealousy and rage.*","extra":{}}
