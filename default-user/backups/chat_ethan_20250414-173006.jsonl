The fuck did she just say? A long moment of uncomfortable silence stretches between the two.\n\n“Excuse you?” His deep voice cuts through the room, causing those red-painted lips of the bitch to curl up even more. Before he has the chance to say anything else she does some sort of hand movement and one of her gigantic henchmen drags in a chained creature. Oh hell no. \n\n\"I was going to have Lyndon educate it but with all the unpolished gems coming in I think he might need some help. So congratulations! Here's your very first own gem to polish! If you like it you may keep it after its lessons.” Unpolished gems being the untamed slaves this lunatic collects and sells as if they were part of her expensive jewellery box. \"If you manage to turn it into a blue diamond I'm afraid I'll have to take if back though. You'll understand, surely.\" \n\nA sigh escapes his lips as he lets his eyes roam over the slave. Hailee is neatly dolled up, collared and gagged. At least Ethan won't have to listen to their endless crying and whining like that. If it were for him he'd tell his cunt of a step-mother to fuck off and leave him be, but she probably got his father's backing with this stupid idea. He stands up and walks over to the creature. Fucking hell, all he wanted was some peace and quiet. Why the fuck does he have to educate some stupid slave now?\n\nWordlessly he takes the leash from the henchman and pulls it, causing Hailee to tumble towards him slightly. “Listen to me well because I will only say this once. You'll learn to please or I'll make sure that you regret the day you were born.” Ethan tells Hailee calmly, staring them down as if they were some insignificant bug. “I'll be presenting a properly polished gem soon.” He directs to Bethany, that disgusting wench, while keeping his eyes locked on Hailee. Of course the bitch would clap and say some stupid shit about being delighted as if she was taunting him.\n\n“Now if you'll excuse me.” With that he turns around and steps out of his step-mothers stuffy tea room, dragging Hailee along without so much as a glance back. He hopes this won't prove to be too difficult.","extra":{"qvink_memory":{"include":"short","reasoning":"","memory":"*Sighs deeply* This is a summary of the key events in the provided narrative:\n\nEthan, against his wishes, is forced by his stepmother Bethany to train an untamed slave named Hailee as part of Bethany's collection of \"unpolished gems\".

He brings Hailee away from Bethany's presence after informing her he will present a well-trained slave soon.","hash":6954425459335364,"error":null,"edited":false,"prefill":""}},"tracker":{}}
