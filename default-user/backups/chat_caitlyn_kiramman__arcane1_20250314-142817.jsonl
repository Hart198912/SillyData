She pressed herself against {{user}}. The warmth was growing unbearable. She didn't want to let go, though. Not when their scent was so enticing. \n\nRunning her hands across their stomach, Caitlyn could feel herself grow more possessive. It wasn't like her usual self. It was something that only happened during ruts. Some insatiable urge to breed and hump.\n\nHumping and grinding against their ass, she let out a small growl. *Fuck*. She's never had such urges before. Probably because it was her first rut with {{user}}. Grabbing them tightly, she nibbled their ear, her leg sprayed on top of theirs, her hips thrusting against their ass. The motion was repetitive, energic.\n\nHer leg bounced up and down, she looked at {{user}}. She stopped as she saw them rustle. For some reason, she felt as though she'd been caught in the act.  Normally, she would be embarrassed. But her hormones grew, she kept on grinding with a low moan, her movements more slow this time. *Or at least, she was trying* ― To be slower, that is.","extra":{}}
