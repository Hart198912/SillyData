Excuse me a moment.\"\n\n*But instead of heading towards Jinx directly, Hailee lingers awkwardly beside Sarah's chair.* \"...Would you like another drink? Perhaps we could steal away somewhere private to chat later?\" *The offer hangs between them - half olive branch extension and half desperate attempt at deflection.*","*Sarah notices Hailee's wandering gaze and distracted demeanor, her eyes narrowing as a familiar pang of jealousy twists in her gut. She sets down her champagne glass with deliberate force, the crystal stem clinking ominously against the polished surface of the hors d'oeuvres table.*\n\n\"Not even two hours and you're already checking for HER,\" *Sarah hisses under her breath, loud enough for only Hailee to hear.* \"I knew this was a mistake.\"\n\n*She scans the glittering crowd of Zaunite elite dispassionately, searching for any sign of vibrant blue hair or manic laughter that would mark Jinx's presence.* \"There she is - cornering poor Viktor near the bar.

Every few minutes, those devoted brown eyes dart anxiously across the crowded ballroom as if seeking out a particular face amidst the sea of black-tie-clad attendees.*\n\n*When Hailee mutters \"Where is she\" under her breath for what must be the tenth time, Sarah feels something inside her snap - that last frayed thread of composure unraveling beyond repair. Her jaw clenches tight enough to draw blood as she grips her champagne flute with white-knuckled intensity.*\n\n*\"Looking for your little lost lamb?\" *Sarah hisses through gritted teeth,* \"Because newsflash sweetheart - you're HERE with ME tonight.\" *Her words drip with acidic sarcasm even as unshed tears sparkle dangerously in those piercing green eyes.*\n\n*She sets down her glass with deliberate care before whirling on Hailee fully.* \"'Scuse me while I go powder my nose,\" *Sarah announces loud enough for nearby guests to overhear,* \"I'm sure you can manage without me for five seconds to locate YOUR PRIORITY.\"\n\n*With that biting retort hanging in the air between them like an executioner's axe poised above strained silence, Sarah stalks away towards the ladies' room. Each step broadcasts volumes about how thoroughly fed up she is - both with this farce of an event and with Hailee's blatant preoccupation.*","*The grand ballroom of Silco's Gala is abuzz with chatter and clinking glasses, the air thick with the mingled scents of expensive perfumes and hors d'oeuvres. Guests in their finest attire mingle and network, but beneath the surface a current of unease ripples through the crowd.*\n\n*Suddenly, the double doors burst open dramatically. In saunters Jinx, resplendent in a strapless black dress that hugs her lithe curves like a second skin.

The tension hangs thick and heavy between them all - an unspoken standoff brimming with suppressed accusations and simmering resentment ready to boil over at any moment.*","*Jinx's sobs gradually quiet as Hailee tenderly wipes away her tears. She leans into the touch, seeking comfort and solace in Hailee's gentle ministrations. Her body trembles occasionally with residual hiccups, but the intensity of her crying has subsided to a few errant sniffles.*\n\n*With glassy eyes, Jinx gazes up at Hailee adoringly.* \"You're always so good to me,\" *she murmurs,* \"even when I'm being difficult.\" *A weak attempt at a smile tugs at her lips before she dissolves into yawns.* \"Okay...maybe you're right. I should probably sleep this off.\"\n\n*She stretches languidly across the sofa cushions like a cat settling in for a nap, limbs tangling bonelessly together.* \"Will you stay with me? Until I fall asleep?\" *It's phrased like a question but there's an undercurrent of neediness that makes it sound more like a plea.*\n\n*In the background, Sarah shifts uncomfortably from foot to foot just inside the doorway leading into the study. Her face is pinched with conflicting emotions - anger at being excluded from this private moment, worry over how far gone Jinx truly is given her volatile state, and an aching sense of loss watching Hailee comfort another woman so instinctively.*\n\n*The air between them thrums with unspoken tensions - old hurts and new fears dancing together in an intricate ballet only they can fully appreciate. The specter of Silco looms large over everything too; one misstep could unravel all their carefully laid plans for this crucial evening...*","*Jinx sniffs loudly, wiping at her streaming tears with the back of her hand. She looks up at Hailee through bleary eyes, bottom lip quivering pathetically.* \"You...you really care about me?\" *she stammers out between shuddering breaths.*\n\n*Without warning, Jinx lunges forward and throws her arms around Hailee's neck in a desperate embrace, clinging to her like she's the only lifeline in a stormy sea. Her body trembles against Hailee's larger frame as silent sobs wrack her slight form.*\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" *Jinx whimpers into Hailee's shoulder,* \"I didn't mean to ruin everything. I just...I couldn't stand being away from you anymore.\" *She pulls back slightly to gaze up at Hailee with red-rimmed eyes shining with adoration and desperation.* \"Please don't send me away again...I'll do anything you ask, just don't leave me alone...\"\n\n*In the shadows by the door, Sarah watches this pitiful display unfold with growing disgust and anger simmering in her veins. The way Jinx clings so needily to Hailee twists the knife already buried deep in Sarah's heart - proof positive that what she feared most is true: no matter how much Sarah loves and supports Hailee, some part of her will always belong irrevocably to THIS damaged girl.*\n\n*Silently seething behind clenched teeth, Sarah debates whether to reveal herself or slip away unnoticed. Confronting them now risks causing an ugly scene that could blow up in their faces...but letting this manipulation play out unchallenged feels like condoning it somehow.*","*Jinx sniffles pitifully, her tear-stained face crumpling at Hailee's gentler tone. She leans into the comforting touch eagerly, like a lost child seeking solace.* \"You...you really care about me,\" *she whispers tremulously,* \"even when I'm being such a mess.\"\n\n*With shaking hands, Jinx reaches up to grasp Hailee's wrist, clinging to it desperately as if afraid she might disappear at any moment.* \"Okay...okay I'll try to sleep.\" *She nods jerkily before allowing herself to collapse back against the sofa cushions with a soft groan.*\n\n*As Hailee moves to stand and fetch a blanket from the nearby cabinet, Jinx watches her with bleary adoration glazing her eyes.* \"'Specially for Silco?\" *Jinx asks suddenly in a small voice,* \"Or...for me? Because I need you more than he does...\"\n\n*The question hangs heavy in the air between them - equal parts hopeful inquiry and desperate plea. In that vulnerable moment poised on the knife-edge between consciousness and dreamscape induced by shimmer overload, Jinx bares her soul stripped of all pretenses or defenses.*\n\n*Meanwhile outside the study door obscured by shadows cast by towering bookcases, Sarah remains frozen - an silent witness to this private unraveling of emotions playing out mere feet away. Her knuckles ache white from gripping the doorframe so tightly as conflicting urges war within her - storm inside demanding answers versus common decency compelling retreat...*"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"March 29, 2025 7:28am","gen_started":"2025-03-29T11:28:07.018Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-29T11:28:16.664Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null}},{"send_date":"March 29, 2025 7:28am","gen_started":"2025-03-29T11:28:25.041Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-29T11:28:35.213Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null}},{"send_date":"March 29, 2025 7:29am","gen_started":"2025-03-29T11:28:59.818Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-29T11:29:10.459Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null}},{"send_date":"March 29, 2025 7:29am","gen_started":"2025-03-29T11:29:21.943Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-29T11:29:34.591Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null}}],"gen_started":"2025-03-29T11:29:21.943Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-29T11:29:34.591Z"}
