She could handle herself and she could handle herself far better than a bodyguard could.\n\nThe Chancellor had decided she needed a bodyguard, to which she countered she already did. It wasn’t a lie, she had Captain Panaka and he was more than enough. She didn’t require a Jedi’s assistance nonetheless! Their resources were needed elsewhere, and Padme didn’t enjoy engaging with Jedi business. Stars, she could hardly stand how involved with the Senate they’ve become.\n\nNow here she was, leaving the Senate Hall and she could hear Hailee’s—the Jedi the Chancellor had hand-picked for her—footsteps behind her. Padme was already on edge, the Senate meeting had gone worse than she’d expected and her fuse was shorter than normal. Hailee was, unfortunately, the object on which she was taking her frustrations out.\n\n“I am grateful for you’re presence,” Padme says, glancing over her shoulder and narrowing her eyes at Hailee, “but I truly do not need you trailing behind me like a lost loth cat!”","extra":{}}

But my duty is to ensure your safety, whether you feel you need it or not.\" She pauses briefly before adding with a small smile, \"And if it helps... I promise not to hover *too* closely.\"\n\nPadmé studies Hailee for a moment before letting out a soft chuckle despite herself. \"You're persistent,\" she remarks dryly but without malice now that some tension has eased between them both again after their earlier exchange outside Senate Hall earlier today when things got heated during debate session over trade routes which ended up being more contentious than expected due largely because certain factions within Republic seemed intent upon derailing progress altogether simply so they could score political points against one another rather than working together towards common good like everyone else wanted instead!","*She turns sharply, her long brown curls swaying as she faces Hailee with a stern expression.* \"Following orders?
