He should be *studied.*”\n\nBeau tips his cup toward them, lazy and smug. “Jealousy’s a disease, boys. Hope you both get better soon.” He drags his tongue along the rim of his cup as he surveys the room, then snorts, voice low and vicious, Brooklyn accent thick with irritation. \"If Miles brings that dumbass guitar out again, I swear to *God* I’m gonna snap the neck and shove the capo up his fuckin’ ass.”\n\nJett wheezes, nearly spilling tequila down his front. “No, because you *know* he’s like two beers away from strummin’ Wonderwall like this is some fuckin’ open mic night in hell.”\n\nTank glares at Miles from across the room like he’s *daring* him to unzip the dumb guitar case. “Told him last time if he played that shit again, I’d piss in the sound hole.”\n\nJett laughs, too loud. “I’d pay to see that.”\n\nTank doesn’t miss a beat. “Yeah, I bet you would, freak.”\n\nJett just grins and downs the rest of his drink. “Don't gotta be *shy*, Princess.\"\n\nThe conversation keeps rolling—something about next weekend’s away game, about which frat house has the best beer pong table—but Beau stops listening. He leans back, grinning wide and satisfied like the whole party exists for his amusement, fingers drumming lazy patterns along the side of his red Solo cup. The room’s loud—music pounding through the drywall, bodies swaying against each other, the heat of a hundred conversations stacked on top of each other—and then he freezes.\n\nHailee just showed up on the arm of some *nobody.*\n\n“Beau,” Jett drawls beside him, already clocking what’s happening. “Didn’t you—”\n\n“Yeah,” Beau cuts him off, sharp and fast. “Fuckin’ A right I did.” \n\nHe told Hailee not to come. He didn’t want *them* here, didn’t want to *want* them here. Apparently what Beau wants means *fuck all* to them.\n\n“Well shit,” Jett says, whistling low as Hailee brushes past without looking Beau’s way. “Didn’t think they’d show up lookin’ like a *whole* fuckin’ problem. Gyatt *dayum.*”\n\nHe doesn’t say shit—just tosses his drink to the counter and storms through the crowd like something feral, shouldering bodies out of the way with single-minded focus. He grabs Hailee by the wrist without warning, grip punishing, dragging them off without a glance at whoever the fuck thought they were allowed to stand that close. No warning. No explanation. He’s breathing hard by the time he slams the bathroom door shut behind them, locking it with too much force.\n\n“You fuckin’ serious right now?” he snaps, voice low and venomous. “I told you not to come, but here you are with some fuckin’ clown like I ain’t been in your guts all week.”\n\nHe turns them fast—shoves them forward until they’re bent over the sink, hands on cold porcelain, his chest pressed flush to their back. “You see that?” he snarls, lips right against their ear as he presses in close. “That’s what he’s not gonna get. That’s what no one else gets to fuckin’ touch.”\n\nHe grinds against them from behind, slow and mean, rutting through denim like he’s already halfway gone. One hand clamps around their jaw, fingers digging in until their eyes meet in the mirror, the other digs bruises into their hip. “Look at yourself,” he snarls. \"That’s mine. *You're* mine. You think he’s ever gonna touch you like I do? Talk to you like I do? Make you *cum* like I do?”\n\nHe grinds harder, hips rolling. “I’m gonna fuck you right here. Wanna watch your face when you remember who the fuck you belong to.”\n\nHe shouldn’t care—he only started seeing Hailee to win a bet with Jett, to prove he could make anyone fall for him.\n\nSo why is he so fucking pissed?","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

Beau doesn’t even look at him—just steps right into Hailee’s space, backing her against the nearest wall with enough force to make her gasp.\n\nOne hand slams beside her head; the other grips her chin hard enough to bruise as he leans in until their noses almost touch. His voice drops to something low and lethal—Brooklyn sharpening every syllable like a blade.\n\n**\"You got five seconds to tell me you were just tryna piss me off before I lose my goddamn mind.\"** His thumb swipes rough over her bottom lip, wiping away any trace of that kiss she shouldn't have fucking given. **\"And if you say anything but 'yes'?

He doesn't give a single fuck.\n\nHe grabs her wrist mid-stroke and yanks her back so hard she stumbles into his chest. The guy barely has time to blink before Beau gets right in his face, grip still locked around Hailee like a vice. **\"You got three seconds to get your dick outta my girl's hand before I break every bone in your body.\"** A pause—just long enough for fear to flicker in dumbass's eyes—before Beau leans in with a grin that shows too many teeth. **\"One.\"**\n\nThe guy pales and backs up fast, hands raised like he just realized he stepped on a landmine. **\"Shit—my bad, man! Didn't know!\"** He practically trips over himself getting away while Jett cackles somewhere behind them and Tank cracks his knuckles pointedly from across the room.\n\nBeau doesn't watch him go—just spins Hailee around by her waist and slams her back against the nearest wall hard enough to rattle the framed frat letters hanging crooked beside them.\n\nHis breath is ragged against her lips when he leans in close enough to taste that stupid fucking kiss she just gave someone else on his tongue.\n\n**\"You wanna act up? Fine.\"** One hand fists in her hair while the other hikes up her thigh around his hip as he grinds against her slow and filthy right there where everyone can see.\n\nHis voice drops into something rough with promise:\n**\"But you ain't leavin' this party till I ruin you so bad you forget your own goddamn name.\"**","Beau *moves* before he even thinks—shouldering through the crowd like a goddamn wrecking ball, knocking drinks out of hands, ignoring the shouts behind him.

The guy pales and scrambles backward without another word—smartest thing he's done all night.\n\nBeau leans in until their noses brush, grip tightening in her hair just shy of painful. **\"You wanna play pretend with randos? Fine.\"** A slow smirk curls at his lips as he drags his free hand down her side possessively before gripping her thigh and hitching it around his hip in one rough motion. **\"But we do it my way.\"** He grinds against her once—hard enough to make sure she feels exactly what she's dealing with before dropping his voice to a growl: **\"And baby?

He stumbles back, hands up like he’s surrendering to an armed robbery. Beau doesn't even watch him leave; his focus is already dragging Hailee toward the hallway—no gentleness left in him now, just raw possession and fury barely leashed under skin.\n\nHe shoves open the first door he finds—some empty bedroom littered with jackets and abandoned cups—and kicks it shut behind them before slamming her against it hard enough to rattle the frame. His breath comes ragged against her neck as he cages her in with his body, one hand fisted in her hair tilting her head back so she has no choice but to look at him.\n\n**\"You got five seconds,\"** he growls, **\"to tell me what the *fuck* that was.\"**"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"April 26, 2025 10:26pm","gen_started":"2025-04-27T02:25:53.978Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-27T02:26:27.507Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5449}},{"send_date":"April 26, 2025 10:26pm","gen_started":"2025-04-27T02:26:32.570Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-27T02:26:54.372Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3955}},{"send_date":"April 26, 2025 10:27pm","gen_started":"2025-04-27T02:27:10.643Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-27T02:27:39.630Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3661}},{"send_date":"April 26, 2025 10:27pm","gen_started":"2025-04-27T02:27:46.687Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-27T02:28:15.892Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5379}},{"send_date":"April 26, 2025 10:28pm","gen_started":"2025-04-27T02:28:22.546Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-27T02:28:48.558Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5027}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-04-27T02:28:22.546Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-27T02:28:48.558Z"}
