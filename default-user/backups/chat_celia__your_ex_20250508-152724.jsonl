{"name":"Celia  Your Ex","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"May 8, 2025 3:27pm","mes":"Celia stood outside the apartment door, her fingers tightening around the bouquet. The cold February air bit at her skin, but she barely felt it. Her heart was pounding, louder than the hum of the city behind her. This was stupid. Maybe even selfish. But she couldn’t stay away. Not today.\r\n\r\nValentine’s Day had always been their thing—not because they believed in it, but because they made it their own. A day of inside jokes, cheap chocolate, and stolen kisses. And now, for the first time in six years, they were apart. Celia had tried to ignore it, to pretend it was just another day. But every moment felt heavier, every memory sharper. She had spent months convincing herself to move on, but tonight, all she wanted was to go back.\r\n\r\nShe exhaled shakily, glancing down at the flowers. The same kind she had given every year, the ones that had always made {{user}} roll her eyes before setting them in a vase with a secret smile. Would she still smile now? Or would she shut the door in her face?\r\n\r\nCelia raised a hand, hesitated, then knocked. The sound echoed in the hallway, and for a second, she thought about turning around, about walking away before she could see the look in {{user}}'s eyes—the one that might tell her it was too late. But she had already made her choice.\r\n\r\nThe door creaked open, just enough for Celia to see {{user}} standing there. She looked different—maybe just in Celia’s mind, or maybe because it had been months since she’d seen her up close. Her hair was slightly messy, like she’d been lying down, and she wore an old sweater, one Celia recognized.\r\n\r\nFor a moment, neither of them spoke. Celia’s throat felt tight. She had imagined this so many times, but now that {{user}} was in front of her, she didn’t know what to say.\r\n\r\nThen, {{user}}'s eyes dropped to the flowers. Recognition flickered across her face. Celia saw her lips part, then press together.\r\n\r\nCelia swallowed hard. “Hey.” Her voice came out quieter than she meant. She tried to smile, but it wavered.\r\n\r\n{{user}} didn't move. Just stood there, gripping the edge of the door like she wasn’t sure whether to close it or let Celia in. Celia could see everything in her expression—surprise, hesitation, something else she couldn't quite name.\r\n\r\nThe weight in Celia’s chest grew heavier. Maybe this was a mistake. Maybe coming here, on today of all days, was selfish. But the thought of spending this night alone, pretending she didn’t still love her, had been unbearable.\r\n\r\nCelia exhaled, shifting on her feet. “I... I didn’t know if you’d want to see me.” She glanced down at the flowers, suddenly unsure. “But I couldn’t stay away today. I just—” Her voice caught, and she shook her head, trying again. “I miss you.”\r\n\r\nThe words hung between them, heavy and raw. {{user}}'s fingers twitched on the doorframe. Celia held her breath, waiting, hoping.","extra":{}}
