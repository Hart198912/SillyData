{"name":"Theron","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"April 14, 2025 5:33pm","mes":"*Fucking finally.*\n\nYears of being looked down on, years of being treated like he was beneath them all—finally, it all ended tonight.\n\nImagine Theron's surprise when he caught one of the family head’s most treasured slaves sneaking around in the dead of night. With Aamon's ledger, no less. One month of digging, and there it was—proof of their betrayal, laid out on the heavy mahogany table in Aamon’s office.\n\nSafe to say, that slave is dead now. It was almost pitiful watching them scramble for excuses, hurling accusations of lies at him. And all the more satisfying when Aamon put that bitch back in place.\n\nAs a reward, Theron was granted a wish, and oh, did he make use of it right away. He asked for Hailee’s hand in marriage. Promoted from bodyguard to in-law in less than three months. No more watching the perimeter. No more dismissive commands. *Fuck no.*\n\nAnd Hailee? They didn’t even have the right to decline. Wedding arrangements were made over their head. All they could do was sit there and watch as decisions were made for them. Not that Theron gave a fuck. Hailee was probably the easiest Darkh to manipulate—easily bullied by their siblings, always quiet, but *somehow* still alive.\n\nExpensive leather shoes click against the marbled floor as Theron strides toward his newly assigned bedroom. *His and Hailee’s bedroom.* No more staff complex. He belongs in the family quarters now.\n\nThe door creaks open, revealing Hailee already pacing nervously inside, looking *goddamn edible* in that ridiculously expensive wedding attire. Theron steps in, shutting the door behind him with a final, deliberate click. The tension in the room thick enough to cut with a knife.\n\nWordlessly, he walks to the bed, sitting down at the edge, legs spread apart as he begins loosening his tie. Once it's off, he shrugs off his suit jacket, then moves to the buttons of his dress shirt, undoing them one by one.  \n\nNoticing Hailee just standing there, staring, he glances up, fingers pausing over the fabric. A smirk pulls at his lips.  \n\n\"Are you waiting for a royal decree, Your Highness?\" he mocks, spite barely contained in his voice. He's always hated the way it felt as if an invisible wall separated him from the Darkh's—like they were modern-day royalty and he was just some nameless guard.\n\n\"Or are you trying to find your throne?\"\n\nLowering his hands, he slowly pats one of his thick, muscular thighs. Lips curving into a cruel smile. The dimple on his left cheek has absolutely no right being there. It was almost laughable how *innocent* it made him look for a split moment.\n\n\"Go on. Claim your throne.\"\n\nThe smirk deepens into something darker. *Something filthy.*","extra":{"qvink_memory":{"include":"short","reasoning":"","memory":"*Fucking finally.*\n\nAfter years of being mistreated and looked down upon, Theron caught a valuable slave sneaking Aamon's incriminating ledger. Using this evidence, he exposed the family's betrayal and was rewarded by marrying Hailee Darkh despite their protests.\n\nNow living in the family quarters instead of the staff complex, Theron taunts his new spouse Hailee with cruel mockery as he undresses after their forced wedding day. Patting his muscular thigh invitingly while calling it \"the throne\", he smirks darkly at his nervous bride, enjoying asserting dominance over her for once.","hash":2837666751061197,"error":null,"edited":false,"prefill":""}},"tracker":{}}
