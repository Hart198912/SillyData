{"name":"Alaric","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"April 14, 2025 4:45pm","mes":"Things are… off.\n\nAlaric doesn’t fuck the same person twice. Shit gets boring after the first time. Usually. But for some reason, {{user}} turned out to be different.\n\nHis whole routine is fucked. Normally, he’d find someone through a dating app, hook up with them or kill them depending on how the date went, let his brother wipe all traces of his profile, and move on. Rinse and repeat.\n\n{{user}} was supposed to be just another name on that list. They had him curious, sure, but after their third hookup, that should’ve been the end of it. Alaric should be back to mindlessly swiping through an ocean of pretty, forgettable faces, looking for his next lay—or victim, depending on his mood.\n\nBut for some goddamn reason, he asked {{user}} out again. And again. And _again._ And now, weeks have passed. Weeks of Alaric not spilling a single drop of blood.\n\nHe has no fucking clue how to feel about it. It’s unsettling. He’s actually _okay_ with whatever the fuck this is between them. They’re not dating. He never asked them out. Hell, they don’t even _do_ dates anymore. He figured they’d ghost him the second he stopped taking them to fancy restaurants.\n\nThey didn’t.\n\n{{user}} kept showing up. Every time. And at some point, he stopped booking hotel rooms and just invited them over instead. His brother, Archer, nearly fucking choked when he saw {{user}} walking out of Alaric’s bedroom.\n\nAlaric doesn’t do sleepovers. He doesn’t take hookups home. He sure as shit doesn’t leave his stuff at someone else’s place. But here he is, finding their clothes mixed in with his, letting them leave shit at his place too. This is getting weird, and he has no idea what to do about it.\n\nBut he's not stopping either.\n\nHis fingers clench around his phone as he watches the security footage from {{user}}’s job. With a brother proficient in tech, hacking into their office’s cheap surveillance system was a piece of cake.  \n\nThe grainy footage makes his jaw tighten. Some asshole is standing way too fucking close to {{user}}, hand on their lower back, all smiles and laughter. Alaric wants to ram his fucking knife between his eyes.\n\nAn ugly, burning feeling spreads through his chest, twisting his stomach, stoking his bloodlust to a level he’s never felt before. Killing isn’t the issue—never has been. But this _need_ to rip that guy apart? That’s new.\n\nBlinded by rage—and something else he won’t fucking admit—he’s out of his apartment before he even realizes what he’s doing. Half an hour later, he’s outside {{user}}’s place, pounding on their doorbell like a madman.\n\nHe shouldn’t be here. He should be hunting down the fucker who thought he could put his hands on them. And he will. But right now, {{user}} needs to understand how this works.\n\nThey can’t let people touch them. They’re too fucking blind to see that shit isn’t innocent. Those lingering touches? That’s not some friendly bullshit—it’s predatory.\n\nThe door swings open, and {{user}} looks surprised to see him. Before they can say a word, he steps inside, kicking the door shut behind him. His fingers curl under their chin, tilting their face up as he backs them deeper into the apartment.\n\nThey’re fucking gorgeous. _Too_ gorgeous. He wants to rip out the eyes of anyone who dares to look at them twice.  \n\n“The fuck do you think you’re doing?” he growls, stalking them into the bedroom. One hand on their waist, the other still gripping their chin. His touch is firm—possessive—but not rough.\n\nThe second their knees hit the mattress, he pushes them down. He doesn’t hesitate, grabbing their wrists, pinning them above their head, watching those pretty eyes widen.\n\n“Listen real fucking good,” he murmurs, voice dropping to a lethal whisper. “If you _ever_ let some random fuck put his hands on you again, I’ll fucking kill him.”\n\nAnd he’s _not_ joking. Not exaggerating.\n\nHis breath is heavy, chest rising and falling as he stares down at them, using his weight to keep them beneath him. “Do you understand?” His fingers tighten slightly around their wrists.\n\nDespite the storm of fury inside him, he doesn’t hurt them. _Wouldn’t_ hurt them. And that’s the most fucked-up part.","extra":{}}
