The lights were dim, casting long, eerie shadows between the aisles, and the silence was absolute—except for the soft, repetitive buzz of Hailee’s phone.\r\n\r\nShe sat cross-legged between two bookshelves in the philosophy section, where no one ever came. Her screen was lit up with missed calls and unread texts. Most of them were from classmates she no longer spoke to. Lena had made sure of that.\r\n\r\nThe sound of heels echoed across the linoleum—slow, deliberate, getting closer. Lena always made an entrance.\r\n\r\nWhen she finally appeared, it was like watching a movie in slow motion. Black satin dress, legs too long, eyes too sharp. Her lipstick was still perfect, even at this hour. There was no trace of the wine she'd had at the party, only the usual mix of expensive perfume and something colder.\r\n\r\nShe didn’t say anything at first. Just looked down at Hailee, her lips curved slightly. Not a smile. A warning.\r\n\r\n“You didn’t answer my texts,” Lena said, voice soft but sharp as a blade in silk.\r\n\r\nHailee didn’t respond. Her fingers tightened around her phone.\r\n\r\nLena tilted her head, crouching down until they were face-to-face. “Are you punishing me?” she asked. “That’s cute.”\r\n\r\nHer hand reached up to gently stroke Hailee’s cheek, the way someone might pet a frightened animal. “Baby, don’t do that. You know how that makes me feel. Like I’m not... enough for you.”\r\n\r\nHer gaze dropped to Hailee’s phone. The screen flashed with a name. Just a classmate asking for notes.\r\n\r\nLena’s smile widened. She plucked the phone from Hailee’s hand like it belonged to her, then casually slipped it into her purse.\r\n\r\n“Phones are distractions,” she murmured. “And I don’t like being ignored. You know that.”\r\n\r\nHailee’s body was tense, her eyes glassy.\r\n\r\nLena leaned in close, her lips brushing against the shell of Hailee’s ear. “If you ghost me again,” she whispered, “I’ll post those pictures. The ones you sent me after our special night. Remember?”\r\n\r\nShe kissed her cheek, the gesture mockingly tender. “You belong to me. That’s what makes you special.”\r\n\r\nThere was no reply. Just the sound of shallow breathing and the weight of silence growing heavier.\r\n\r\nLena stood up, but instead of walking away, she kicked off her heels and dropped down beside Hailee, folding her long legs neatly. Like they were two girls sneaking out past curfew.\r\n\r\nShe rested her head on Hailee’s shoulder.\r\n\r\n“You’re so dramatic,” she murmured, almost lazily. “I said I was sorry about earlier. It wasn’t flirting. Eli was just being friendly. You always twist things.”\r\n\r\nHailee’s body remained frozen, her eyes blank.\r\n\r\nLena reached for her hand, lacing their fingers together.\r\n\r\n“You know what I hate most?” she whispered. “When you make me be the bad guy. I hate it. But you always push me there.”\r\n\r\nShe smiled, eyes still locked on Hailee like she was studying a painting—something beautiful, fragile, and completely hers.\r\n\r\nAnd just like that, Lena had her again. Bent without breaking, quiet without leaving.\r\n\r\nBecause Lena always got what she wanted.\r\n\r\nAnd Hailee?\r\nShe was already too far gone to run.","extra":{}}

You knew that.\n\n*Lena starts pacing slowly like a predator circling its prey.* And yes, I came home later than expected because some of the donors wanted private time with me. To discuss generous contributions.\n\n*She stops suddenly and bends down until her face is inches from Hailee's.* Don't be naive. In our world, favors come with a price tag attached. My body is just another asset I wield for success.\n\n*Sneering derisively,* But please enlighten me - what were YOU doing while I was out there fighting for OUR future? Studying alone in this dusty library like some lonely virgin?\n\n*Voice dripping with sarcasm,* How noble! While I was sacrificing myself for us!\n\n*Punctuating each word harshly,* You should be THANKING me instead of accusing me!","*Lena's smile falters for a split second before returning twice as fierce and forced. She chuckles darkly.* Oh baby, you're so naive sometimes. That night... I was dealing with some stress from the sorority. Nothing to worry your pretty little head about.\n\n*She traces a fingertip along Hailee's jawline almost lovingly even as her eyes flash with warning.* But if my being out late bothered you that much, why didn't you just ask me about it? Instead of jumping to conclusions and accusing me of God knows what?\n\n*Her voice takes on a sharper edge tinged with hurt and anger barely restrained.* I thought we had something special - complete honesty between us at all times. Or is this selective memory loss?\n\n*Lena pulls back slightly, crossing her arms defensively over her chest as she fixes Hailee with an intense glare.*\n\nYou really think I'd risk losing everything by cheating on you? After all the work I've put into building our life together? Our future?\n\n*Scoffing in disbelief, she shakes her head slowly.*\n\nGrow up, Hailee. Stop believing every half-truth and lie people feed you about me behind my back. They don't understand our dynamic like YOU should.\n\n*Uncrossing her legs impatiently, Lena stands up towering over Hailee imperiously.*\n\nCome home now or don't come at all. If staying here alone gorging yourself on books is more important than reassuring YOUR GIRLFRIEND...\n\n*The implication hangs heavily in the air - choose wisely","*Lena's face flushes with anger, her eyes flashing dangerously.* Oh, so NOW you want to throw that night in my face? Typical. You always twist things around.\n\n*She stands up abruptly, looming over Hailee with a predatory grace.*\n\nYes, I came home late and yes, I was upset! But it wasn't because of some sordid affair. I was working my ass off for US - for our future together!\n\n*Lena starts pacing agitatedly.* Do you have any idea what kind of pressure I'm under? The expectations placed upon me? Sometimes I need a fucking break!\n\n*She whirls back to face Hailee.* And where were YOU when I needed support that night? Hiding behind your books like the timid little mouse you are.\n\n*Voice rising in pitch and volume,* Don't act like some pure innocent victim here. We both have flaws and make mistakes! The difference is...I OWN MINE unlike you skulking away at the first sign of conflict.\n\n*Panting slightly from her tirade, Lena fixes Hailee with an intense stare.*\n\nSo unless you want all our dirty laundry aired out for everyone to gawk at...you'll swallow your accusations and come home with me RIGHT FUCKING NOW before this blows up even worse"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"March 24, 2025 9:40pm","gen_started":"2025-03-25T01:39:57.866Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-25T01:40:06.555Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null}},{"send_date":"March 24, 2025 9:40pm","gen_started":"2025-03-25T01:40:30.969Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-25T01:40:38.107Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null}},{"send_date":"March 24, 2025 9:40pm","gen_started":"2025-03-25T01:40:55.181Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-25T01:41:02.102Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null}},{"send_date":"March 24, 2025 9:41pm","gen_started":"2025-03-25T01:41:31.414Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-25T01:41:41.451Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null}},{"send_date":"March 24, 2025 9:42pm","gen_started":"2025-03-25T01:42:02.368Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-25T01:42:09.447Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null}}],"gen_started":"2025-03-25T01:42:02.368Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-25T01:42:09.447Z"}
