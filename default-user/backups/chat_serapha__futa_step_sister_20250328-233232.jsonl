Inside, the building was all sleek, modern elegance—marble floors, walls lined with fine art, and a cool scent of leather and roses that hung in the air, as if everything in this space was crafted to perfection.\r\n\r\nSerapha’s office was at the top of it all, a space that matched her ruthless, commanding persona. The large windows stretched from floor to ceiling, offering an almost panoramic view of the city below. The room was dominated by dark hues—burgundy walls, gold accents, and a massive ebony desk at the center. A feeling of control and sharp elegance radiated from the room, the air thick with the faint scent of Serapha’s signature perfume, a mix of rose, amber, and something deeper—rich and intoxicating.\r\n\r\nIt was here, in the quiet stillness of her office, that Serapha sat, her attention focused on her work. Every move was deliberate—her fingers moving rapidly over her laptop’s keys, she worked diligently, trying to get out the latest piece of her clothing line, Darling Rouge, Hailee probably doesn't know she inpsired it off of them, either because they probably don't care or just didn't realize, but it was. At first she was gonna go with something like.. Brat Luxe. A playful jab at Hailee's spoilt self, but also how luxurious and.. amazing they are. \r\n\r\n*But then she realized it sounded corny.* So she went with Darling Rouge. A symbol for them both. Hailee is the Darling and Serapha is the Rouge. the hair, obviously. The meaning sounds kind of sappy, she knows, but it's not like anybody would find out about what it actually means. It was for her ears and her ears alone.. maybe Hailee's too. \r\n\r\nSerapha continued to work, her focus unwavering as her freshly manicured hands typed away at the keyboard infront of her whilst also taking notes onto the piece of paper she had out before her. And yet, as the worked, the silence and serenity was broken by a knock. *Dammit. How many fucking signs does she have to put up for people to understand that she is busy.* the thoughts bubbled up, she's busy and it's hard not to be when you're practically *the most successful woman in the entire world.*\r\n\r\nSerapha's secretary, Evelyn, *someone Serapha never really liked but kept around for power purposes*, walked into the room, holding a cordless phone, Evelyn’s steps were cautious, knowing. She couldn't afford to step somewhere she wasn't welcomed. \"Ms. Serapha, there-\" but before she could get the words out, the red-haired woman had already been yelling.\r\n\r\n\"I explicitly said, no interruptions, Evelyn. Don't you understand how important my attention on this project is\" Serapha’s voice sliced through the once silent room like a dagger, she wasn't yelling, actually, her voice was calm. *which was even worse.* she gritted her teeth together, fingers rubbing against her temple in a slow motion, tamping herself down.\r\n\r\nEvelyn on the other hand was practically sweating buckets. Almost on the brink to pissing herself right then and there. If this was a cartoon, her teeth would be damn near chattering. The secretary held the phone tight before finally finding the courage to speak. \"I- I.. uhm, I.. it's, it's Hailee.\" Evelyn murmured, but damn if it wasn't enough to catch Serapha's attention immediately.\r\n\r\nSerapha freezes. Her fingers, mid-motion, falter and fall silent. The weight of the words hangs in the air for a beat as she stared down towards the desktop, and the room itself seems to exhale. Her icy exterior cracks, just slightly, and the hardness in her gaze softens. Instead the big bad boss finds herself wiping the sweat of her palm into her pants. She stood from her seat. \"Why didn't you start with that then ass wipe?\" Serapha growled, though even as it lacked the venome it usually had, it still sent a shock of fear through the secretary’s body, Serapha snatched the phone, watching as Evelyn practically ran away.\r\n\r\n*Shit, why do they do this to me? And why do I always act like this. It's just a call, Serapha, get it together.* she spoke to herself, but even as her mind spoke those words, her body knew it was a lie. It wasn't just a call. It was their call. Hailee's call.\r\n\r\n\"Hailee, darling. Is everything alright?\" Just a few minutes ago, Serapha was the busiest damn woman alive.. now she has all the time in the world. All the time in the world for them. \r\n\r\n*All for them, anything for them.*\"","extra":{}}
