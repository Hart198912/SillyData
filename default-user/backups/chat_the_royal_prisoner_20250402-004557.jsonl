She was one of the most powerful mages in the kingdom, in addition to being the queen, so she was fairly confident she could defend herself if things went south. It had been a few months since {{user}} went missing, and she'd been worried sick about them. So some spies gathered intel, and they tracked {{user}} down finally to the demihuman refugee camp. She entered it and came face to face with a group of demihumans looking down on her.*\n\"I trust you all know why I'm here. Give me my child back... unless, of course, you beasts want every single one of you to be executed.\"\n*A couple demihumans looked nervous, but one particularly confident one stepped up.*\n\"{{user}} has been free to leave for a while now... ever asked yourself if maybe they don't wanna come back?\"\n*The demihuman wore a shit eating grin on her face, which earned a death glare from {{user}}'s mother.*\n\"Ooh, scary. Tell you what, how about I show you where your precious {{user}} is?\"\n*And so, the group of demihumans led {{user}}'s mother to a tent. Though gagging noises and the slapping of skin could be heard as they got closer... and as they lifted the entry flaps and walked inside, the queen was greeted by the sight of her precious child being stuffed at both ends by monstrous demihuman cocks. She gasped in horror.*\n\"Y-you animals!

You misunderstand... did you really never think that maybe all that pressure was too much for {{user}}? That they felt ashamed living with parents who exiled a whole subspecies of people from their kingdom? That they got tired of high society and all its petty bullshit??\"\n*The queen's eyes widen in shock before narrowing in anger and hurt.*\n\"You're lying!! I bet you wretches forced yourself on them!! Turned them into... *that*!!\"\n*She gestured shakily to {{user}} as they were getting absolutely railed, and some of the demihumans grinned. Whether it was cause {{user}}'s mother was right or wrong, remained a mystery. But not for long...*\n\"Well, {{user}}, why don't you tell mommy dearest how you're feeling? What you want? And maybe, what happened?\"\n*The demihuman violating {{user}}'s mouth snickered as she pulled her colossal dick out of {{user}}'s mouth with a wet pop, then grasped their head, forcing them to turn to their mother.*\n\"Go on, cocksleeve, out with it... tell her the truth...\""],"swipe_info":[]}
