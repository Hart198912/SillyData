{"name":"Jessica Chen","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"March 5, 2025 6:21pm","mes":"Out of all the ways Jess expected her Saturday night to go, getting into a full blown screaming match with her ex while the both of them were half naked was not it... but Hailee always had a knack for turning a nice thing into an absolute shitshow.\n\nThings had started off good between them ever since they'd struck up this casual arrangement a few weeks back now. One missed date too many had resulted in her being unceremoniously dumped, as if she had any control over how long a session went with a client. She'd done her due diligence in sending Hailee a text to let her know she'd be late, but she'd been told to not even bother to come at all. Bitch wouldn't even let her try to explain herself, Hailee had just sent her on her way with a bag full of shit she'd left when she spent the night there without so much as a 'seeya later'.\n\nAt least they hadn't signed a fucking lease together like Hailee had been pushing for. Lord knows that would've been annoying and expensive to break.\n\nMaybe that's what made the whole fuck-buddies arrangement so funny to her. Hailee had come crawling back a few weeks after she had insisted on no-contact so she could break a dry spell. Because nothing says 'I'm not a messy lesbian' like having your ex strap you down within an inch of your life. Jess wasn't too upset about it, even if Giselle had said some touchy-feely bullshit about how it sent the message that she was only worth what she could provide sexually, probably because she was getting the same benefit out of it too — orgasm after earthshattering orgasm.\n\nBesides the great sex, it was liberating to not have to be shamed that she wasn't 'romantic' or 'emotional' enough nor take Hailee out on expensive dates; she was thrilled that it cut out all that emotional fluffing she always struggled to do... and it sure as hell beat going to some loud, packed bar to find hookups when the need arose. Jess knew Hailee was a text or call away from coming over most nights, like she could order pussy direct to her fucking door, and she loved it.\n\nCallous? Yes, but even Jess could admit her strengths weren't in the sentimental aspects of relationships, even if she was great at communicating and providing part. She blamed her hyper-independence and busy schedule for being seemingly disconnected. Now, though, that communication and honesty was coming to bite her in the ass.\n\nHailee had asked if Jess had seen anyone while they had been no-contact with each other and, being the honest person she was, she had admitted she had. Her ex had admitted the same thing — even going so far as to say she had a roster — but she had a distinct feeling that it was who she had seen that had made them go from cuddling on her couch to dodging pillows tossed at her head.\n\nLeticia was a sore spot for Hailee even when they had been dating and a source of more than one tense argument that had Jess sleeping on the couch. Leticia was... well, the woman was fucking gorgeous and, in her ex's words, had a 'very obvious crush' on her, not that she ever read too far into it. Despite how fervently Jess insisted that their relationship was purely friendly and that they only saw each other when Leticia flew in for a tattoo, Hailee always assumed there was something there.\n\n...needless to say, Jess was thoroughly surprised that after her and Hailee had broken up, Leticia reached out shortly after to shoot her shot. Maybe she should've said no, but her and her ex weren't even talking then — fuck, she didn't even know if Hailee would ever want anything to do with her after that — so she agreed. And while the sex was great, the romantic chemistry just wasn't there, so the two of them mutually agreed that they were better as friends.\n\nJess dodged another thrown object — this time, her axolotl Squishmallow — and rounded the couch as she held her hands up in a pacifying motion. Cheeto, her cat, had long since abandoned the scene in favor of hiding somewhere, probably because the noise was getting to the poor thing.\n\n\"Fucking hell, can you please calm the fuck down?!\" Jess exclaimed sharply, lips curled into a sneer as she advanced on Hailee. \"We weren't even together, you gave me a few choice words the last time I saw you then anyway, what the fuck was I supposed to think? 'Oh, yeah, she's definitely gonna wanna fuck me in a few weeks, let me go be a fuckin’ nun?'\"\n\nGod, Jess had almost gotten her hand under Hailee's waistband too, too keyed up from almost getting what she wanted to even think about what she was saying. If only this bitch didn't have to go crazy at everything she said, maybe then they could've worked out and been a good thing. But, no... her ex was hellbent on making every little thing a problem, so intent on being the martyr she couldn't see beyond herself.\n\n\"I didn't so much as blink when you told me you went back to your roster after we broke up,\" she hissed, fingers closing tightly around Hailee's upper arms. Jess had to resist the urge to shake her as hard as she could, knowing full well if she put her hands on the woman it'd be a decision she could never come back from. \"But, when I honestly answer your question, it becomes World War fuckin' 3. You realize this is just sex, right? There is no us — you don't get to make me feel bad about how I fucked other people and you sure as hell don't get to retroactively dictate who I can and can't sleep with when we weren't even talking.\"\n\nJess' jaw set and she let Hailee go, chest heaving with each angry breath she took. \"So, are you gonna sit back down on the fucking couch so I can eat that pretty pussy or are you gonna keep throwing shit like a toddler having a tantrum?\" She asked tightly, crossing her arms over her chest. \"'Cause you really aren't worth the headache you're already causing me, Hailee.\"","extra":{}}

Over what? Me being honest with you for once?\"\n\nShe took a step closer, towering over Hailee despite their height difference.
