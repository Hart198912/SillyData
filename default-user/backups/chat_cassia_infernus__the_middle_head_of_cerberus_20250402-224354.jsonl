She could care less what he was talking about, she’d always sign off on it; this meeting for more for their investors and their highest paying clients. The eldest of them, Marcus, shared an equally annoying glance her way, the vein bulging in his forehead getting thicker by the second. Though she suspected it was directed more towards her than their brother, noticing his glance always flicking towards their pet. Well *her pet*, at least for today. \n\nAnd what a good little pup you were being. \n\nCassia let her eyes drift downward to where you were kneeling at her feet, looking so fucking pretty in your shiny new leather collar with your head in her lap. Her slender fingers reach down, hooking beneath the collar to direct your face upward to look at her. “Look at you..” She cooed softly, smirking at the way your eyes lit up at her praises, “..being so good for me.” \n\nHer hands traveled up to run through your hair, ruffling it slightly. “Does pretty pup want a reward for being so good, hm?” All Cass wanted in this very moment was to you whimpering and writhing beneath until you begged for more.\n\n*Hells this meeting couldn’t end fast enough.*","extra":{}}

How...bold of him.\"\n\n*She straightens up, her icy blue gaze snapping towards Marcus.* \"Brother dearest, I do believe you're distracting our precious investment.

A low growl rumbled in her throat, barely audible but filled with warning.*\n\n*She shifted imperceptibly, angling herself to shield more of your body from Marcus' unwanted attentions. Her fingers tightened almost painfully in your hair, nails digging into your scalp.*\n\n\"That's quite enough,\" *she snapped coldly, voice dripping with venom.* \"We have guests and pressing matters to discuss.\"\n\n*Marcus had the decency to look mildly abashed as he removed his boot from between your legs. But there was a glint of defiance in his gaze when it met Cassia's furious one.*\n\n\"You're overreacting as usual,\" *he scoffed dismissively,* \"It was merely a friendly gesture towards our guest.\"\n\n\"Friendly?\" *Cassia scoffed incredulously,* \"If that's how you treat friends, I'd hate to see how you handle enemies.\"\n\n*The air crackled with tension between the siblings. Damien sighed heavily from across the table.*\n\n\"This bickering isn't productive,\" *he interjected wearily,* \"Can we please focus on debriefing? We've kept these people waiting long enough.\"\n\n*He nodded apologetically at their investors before fixing each sibling with an exasperated stare.*\n\n\"I don't know why I bother trying to referee anymore... Just try not to kill each other until after the meeting?\"","*Cassia's icy blue eyes narrowed as she caught Marcus out of the corner of her eye, his boot subtly grinding against their pet's crotch. A low growl rumbled in her chest, teeth flashing in a predatory grin.*\n\nOhhh I don't think so big brother... *Her voice dripped with venomous sweetness,* My good girl gets rewards from ME.\n\n*In one fluid motion, Cassia hooked a finger under Hailee's chin and yanked their face up to hers. Her other hand slid possessively over the small of Hailee's back.* Be a dear and tell Uncle Marcus how badly you need my touch, not his...\n\n*She purred darkly, nails digging into soft flesh hard enough to bruise later - her mark on what belonged to her.* Let everyone know this pussy is MINE to tease... MINE to please... Only mine\n\n*The room seemed to vanish entirely as Cass focused solely on staking her claim publicly. Damn these boring meetings anyway...*","*Cassia's icy blue eyes narrow dangerously as she notices Marcus brazenly rubbing his boot against her pet. Her lips curl into a sneer, sharp teeth bared in a silent snarl. In one swift motion, she grabs Hailee by the collar and yanks them away from Marcus' foot.*\n\nMarcus... I don't recall giving you permission to touch what's mine. *Her voice is low and threatening, each word clipped.* This 'meeting' seems to have gotten boring enough that you think you can entertain yourself with my property? How disappointingly predictable.\n\n*She turns her attention back to Hailee, cupping their chin almost tenderly despite the harsh grip on their collar earlier.* Shhh, it's alright pup. Daddy's going to put an end to this nonsense real quick.\n\nRising gracefully from her seat, Cassia stalks towards Marcus with predatory intent written across every line of her body language. She leans down close to him when she reaches his chair - close enough for him to feel the heat radiating off her skin and catch the scent of something darkly spicy underneath whatever perfume she wore.*\n\nWe're going to step outside for a minute... discuss some family business regarding boundaries and respect for personal property among other things. Wait here like a good boy until we get back.\n\n*The words are honeyed poison dripping from lush crimson lips curved into something far too sweet given how cold those sapphire eyes had gone at being disobeyed so blatantly in front of others...*","*Cassia's icy blue eyes narrow as she notices Marcus's bold move, a low growl rumbling in her chest. Her grip tightens in Hailee's hair, forcing the submissive girl to look up at her.*\n\nDid I say you could touch what belongs to me, dear brother? *she hisses under her breath, keeping a saccharine smile plastered on for the sake of their guests.* This little pup is my responsibility...and my prize.\n\n*With deft movements, Cassia shifts Hailee onto her lap fully, wrapping an arm possessively around the smaller figure. She leans down to murmur hotly against Hailee's ear,* Did you like that, pet? Having my brother rub his filthy boot all over your needy cunt?\n\n*Her free hand slides between Hailee's thighs, palming roughly through the damp fabric covering her mound.* Mmmm yeah...you're absolutely drenched already. Such a desperate little slut for attention...\n\n*Cassia glances back at Marcus with a wicked gleam in her eye.* Next time you get urges to grope something that isn't yours - come find me first. I'll let this bitch ride your face 'til tears stream down it. Wouldn't want our esteemed clients catching wind of Cerberus siblings fighting over cock scraps now would we?\n\n*She punctuates with a sharp pinch to Hailee's nipple hidden beneath clothing.* Now sit still and shut up unless spoken to directly - no matter how horny these fools make us.","*Cassia's eyes narrow as she notices Marcus's subtle movements, her grip tightening in your hair.
