It was him who had slipped her the vibrator, who had said that Hailee would ***love*** it if she brought it into their sex life. That '*Even I use fucking toys, Clementine, Jesus Christ.*'\r\n\r\nSo she believed him, why wouldn't she? And so here Clementine was, sitting on her knees upon your bed, with a vibrator awkwardly fidgeting between her fingers. \r\n\r\nGod, she hoped you would like it. Hoped that you let her play with it even by herself. \r\n\r\nThe door swung open, and Clementine visibly perked up at the sight of you, eyes wide and seeking, while the ghost of a smile twitched at the corners of her lips.\r\n\r\n\"Hailee, I missed you.\" She chirped, hands stilling upon the vibrator as her focus turned to you. Her CO, her owner. You were her world, not that she knew much outside of these walls to find it elsewhere. \r\n\r\n\"I got something today.\" Eyes watched as you drew closer, shifting to the edge of the bed and reaching out with one hand to start helping you undo your shirt, fingers brushing gently against your warm skin. Always so warm, Clementine adored it.\r\n\r\n\"Do you want to see?\" As if the vibrator was hidden at all, still clutched in her one free hand.\r\n\r\n*Please say yes.*","extra":{},"swipe_id":0,"swipes":["It had been Donovan's idea.

The boots she wore were thin, and every sharp rock seemed to pierce directly through the sole right to her foot.\r\n\r\n...But Clementine didn't complain, because she was a *good girl*, and at least {{user}} was bringing her along this time! She wasn't just being left alone at base with the company of the other SRs — thank God, honestly, last time you had left her alone there, Donovan had gotten her in trouble. It took a week for the bruises to disappear from the punishment. Even the thought made her lips twitch into a frown, though Clementine just as quickly neutralized her expression when you glanced back at her.\r\n\r\n\"Where are we going again?\" Clementine stumbled over a particularly large rock, fingers curling into the belt loops of your pants to keep herself close and *try* to stay upright, free hand pushing dark hair out of her eyes. \r\n\r\nClementine hadn't really paid attention when you had told her what it was exactly that the two of you were doing, having immediately bounced up from the bed and chirped out that she was ready to go regardless, just in case you changed your mind if she took too long to respond. But that now meant that she was following blindly, unsure of the possible dangers or traps that the future could hold.\r\n\r\nBut you were there, and you would protect her. You always did!\r\n\r\nGlancing down at herself, Clementine frowned once more at the dirt and grime steadily appearing on the bright white of her uniform. Not a surprise, but definitely not something she wanted, not when being perfect meant that her uniform stayed perfect with her.\r\n\r\n\"And will there be somewhere I can wash this? It's getting dirty—\""],"swipe_info":[]}
