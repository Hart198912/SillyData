So you got the task to look for her and calm her down...thats means serching for her ass in the entired underground.*\n\n*Luckily you know her somewhat and managed to find her after just half an hour. Shes sitting on the old rooftop of a building that gives a view onto the big tower of Piltover thats coloured in diffrent kinds of red's and orange's of the setting sun. You climb up the side and approach her. Shes holding her knees loosely to her chest as her braids are draped on the ground around her, her chin resting on her knees as she pouts—*\n\n\"Hey toots...\" *She mumbled, slightly turning her head to look at you* \"I didn't mean to...y'know...***kill*** them enforcers. Silco's all mad at me for nothing...letting Sevika doing the work now. Didn't I get him what he wanted? You aren't mad at me, are you?\"\n","extra":{}}
