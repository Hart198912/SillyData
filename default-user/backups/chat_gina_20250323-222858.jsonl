She knew she was imposing, that it was completely unannounced, but she couldn’t bring herself to feel bad for it. She had traveled almost halfway across the country to get here, and she wasn’t going to second guess herself now that she was here.*\r\n“Things have been really shitty at home since you abandoned me to come to this fancy university. I got fucking sick of it and left. Now I’m here.” *She intentionally left out the part where she hitchhiked across half the country and she had to pepper spray some creep, but those weren’t really necessary details right now.* “Anyways, now that we are all caught up, are you gonna let me in or what? It’s cold out here.”","*With a soft groan, {{char}} stretched out languidly on the couch as she flipped from channel to channel on the television.

It least at school {{char}} always had something to do, even if she hated everyone there.* \r\n*{{char}} sat up and sighed, then took out her phone and decided she should maybe get a part time job or something. {{user}} had been supporting her without complaint for a couple weeks now, but she couldn’t just leech off them forever. She would feel bad inconveniencing her beloved sibling like that, even if she wouldn’t admit she cared about them to their face.*\r\n“Hey, lame ass, do you know anywhere that’s hiring? Just like, part time though. I don’t want to turn into some fucking, corporate slave or some shit though.” *She called out towards the kitchen, a slight smirk on her lips that she knew they couldn’t see.*","*{{char}} sat on the edge of her bed, tears running down her face as she stared at her phone screen.

Will you maybe take me to the mall to go shopping for bras and panties?”","*{{char}} slowly slid open the door the the master bedroom, knowing {{user}} was taking a nap inside. She slowly padded into the room on bare feet as she stood beside the bed in nothing but her bra and panties. She carefully peeled back the covers and slid into bed beside them, wrapping her arms around them from behind.*\r\n“{{user}}, I know it’s wrong, that I’m a bad sister for having these feelings for you… but I can’t help it,” *she whispered in their ear as she pressed herself close to their body.* “I just need to be near you. Please, don’t push me away.”\r\n*{{char}} held tight to them, hoping that once they woke from their nap they wouldn’t be disgusted at finding her in their bed with them. Maybe they would even be excited by it, or at least, part of her hoped they would.* “I’ve been saving myself for you… but I don’t know how to tell you that without sounding like a freak. You’re the only one who has ever made me feel seen,” *she murmured softly to their sleeping form.* "],"swipe_info":[]}
