{"name":"BARON FIRST MEET","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"April 16, 2025 7:11pm","mes":"He saw her before she saw him.\r\n\r\nNear the center of his Club 'Zion's' dance floor, dancing and bathed in purple-gold strobe and sweat-slick flash.\r\n\r\nThat was his angel. \r\n\r\nIt didn’t matter that he didn’t know her. He knew the feel of fate when it grabbed him by the throat and instinct always spoke louder than reason.\r\n\r\nHe lit a cigar without breaking stride, watching her from the shadows of the upper tier. Took a drag. Tasted leather, spice, heat… but it didn’t touch the slow burn starting in his chest.\r\n\r\nHe pushed off the bar to make his way over to Hailee. He didn't rush. Savored the approach. \r\n\r\nWhen he finally reached her, stopping just behind her, he didn't speak. Just waited a beat, letting his presence register.\r\n\r\nThen he slid in close. One hand found her hip, firm and low, fingers spreading over the curve just above her ass. Other hand? Grazed the inside of her arm, slow and casual, like he'd done it a hundred times.\r\n\r\nHe guided her body with his, letting her feel just how close he liked his women to be—*all in*. No space left between them but breath and tension.\r\n\r\n\"What's your name, angel?\" Baron's voice was a low rumble against her ear, his lips brushing the sensitive skin just below.\r\n\r\nWhen she told him—*Hailee*—he rolled it across his tongue like fine whiskey, savoring the taste of it. Perfect. His angel had a name that felt like silk between his teeth.\r\n\r\nHe tilted her face up to his, green eyes burning with something that went beyond mere desire. It was ownership—premature but inevitable.\r\n\r\n\"Been waitin' for you,\" he murmured, the words slipped out. Strange but true. He hadn't known he was waiting until she appeared. Then his mouth was on hers, and she tasted like every sin he'd ever committed and a few he hadn't gotten around to yet. He kissed like a man who wasn’t just tasting her—he was *savoring* her. Like the appetizer before a feast he had every intention of devouring later.\r\n\r\nThe kiss wasn’t about asking for permission, it was him taking what he’d already decided was his.\r\n\r\nBut business called. A nagging reminder pulled at the edge of his focus—the rat tied up in the back room, waiting for judgment. Fucking inconvenience.\r\n\r\n\"Gotta handle somethin', angel,\" he said. His thumb traced her swollen bottom lip, satisfaction curling through him. \"Business that can't wait.\"\r\n\r\nBaron signaled to one of the cocktail waitresses, who immediately changed course at his gesture.\r\n\r\n\"This is Hailee,\" he told the waitress. \"Take her to my private section. Make sure she has whatever she wants.\" \r\n\r\nThen he turned back to Hailee, \"Wait for me in VIP, I’ll be back real soon.\"\r\n\r\nHe gave her one last look, one last slow drag of his gaze down her body—like he already owned every inch of what was hidden beneath that dress—then turned.\r\n\r\nHe strode through the employee corridor. Archie fell into step beside him, already chattering about some girl on Hinge, thumbs flying across his phone screen.Baron half-listened, his mind momentarily split between the sweet taste of his newfound angel and the lukewarm chore of putting someone down.\r\n\r\n\"Mate, I'm tellin' you,\" Archie was saying, oblivious to the sudden shift in Baron's focus, \"this bird's somethin' else…\"\r\n\r\nThey reached the unmarked door at the end of the hallway. Baron pushed it open without knocking. The room beyond was sparse—concrete floors, a single metal chair bolted to the ground, harsh overhead lighting. Lars stood casually against the wall, scrolling through his phone, looking bored despite the bloodied man zip-tied to the chair in front of him.\r\n\r\n\"How's our guest?\" Baron asked.\r\n\r\nLars looked up, tucking his phone away with practiced ease. \"Hasn't said much. Seems to think silence will save him.\" His lips quirked slightly. \"Didn't realize the rules about skimming from shipments had changed.\"\r\n\r\nBaron's gaze slid to the man in the chair—mid-thirties, once-expensive suit now stained with sweat and blood, eyes wide with terror above the duct tape stretched across his mouth. Small-time distributor who'd gotten greedy. Thought he could skim product and Baron wouldn't notice. Stupid.\r\n\r\n\"You stayin’, or is this where you pretend you don’t got delicate sensibilities?\" Baron asked Lars, who was already moving toward the door.\r\n\r\n\"If you don't mind, I've got that meeting with the port authority in the morning.\" Lars straightened his cuffs. \"Need to be fresh.\"\r\n\r\nBaron chuckled, low and dry. \"Go on then, pretty boy. I’ll handle clean-up. And Lars?\" His voice dropped slightly. \"Remember, if they push back on the rates, remind them what happened to the last inspector who got too curious.\"\r\n\r\nAs Lars slipped out, Archie wandered closer to their captive, circling him. \"Fancy suit for a dead man innit,\" he observed cheerfully. \"Think it'll fit me? We're about the same height.\"\r\n\r\nBaron chuckled, shrugging off his jacket and draping it carefully over a hook on the wall. \"Might be a bit loose in the shoulders now. Fear has a way of shrinkin' a man.\"\r\n\r\nArchie barked a laugh. \"Bet he's lost five pounds just sittin' here pissin' himself.\"\r\n\r\nBaron approached slowly, rolling up his sleeves to reveal his forearms. He crouched down, eye-level with their guest. With one swift motion, he ripped the duct tape from the man's mouth.\r\n\r\n\"Please,\" the man gasped immediately. \"I can explain—\"\r\n\r\n\"Shhh.\" Baron pressed a finger to the man's lips. \"You had time to explain. When my boys caught you. When Lars asked you nicely. Now?\" He straightened up, reaching behind his back to pull out a silenced pistol. \"Now it's time to listen.\"\r\n\r\nThe man's eyes fixed on the gun, tears streaming down his face. \"I have money—\"\r\n\r\n\"I know you do,\" Baron interrupted softly. \"My money.\" He pressed the silencer against the man's forehead. \"And that's the problem.\"\r\n\r\nThe shot was almost anticlimactic—a muffled pfft followed by the heavy slump of a body gone instantly lifeless. Baron tucked the gun away, expression unchanged, as if he'd just signed a routine document rather than ended a life.\r\n\r\nHe turned to find Jules waiting in the doorway, face impassive.\r\n\r\n\"Get someone to clean this up,\" Baron said, retrieving his jacket. \"And make sure his car disappears too. Permanently.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen he left the room and pushed through the velvet rope separating the VIP section from the plebeian masses below, the transition seamless. One moment, the methodical coldness of necessary violence; the next, the low thrum of manufactured pleasure. His eyes landed on her immediately.\r\n\r\nHailee. Sitting exactly where he'd told the waitress to put her, perched on the edge of the leather couch like a bird contemplating flight. Good girl. She'd waited. \r\n\r\nBaron approached slowly, savoring the moment she spotted him. The way her eyes widened slightly, then dropped to his sleeve where that small blood stain disrupted the perfect white of his button up. \r\n\r\nA slow smirk spread across Baron’s face, amusement bubbling beneath the surface. He hadn’t even bothered checking; the cleanup crew would handle any real mess. But a little splatter? Just enough to tell a story? Perfect. A little test for his angel. Let her have a guess at the world she’d stumbled into. He watched her face—the flicker of uncertainty, the quick calculation behind those pretty eyes as she tried to decide what she'd seen. What it meant.\r\n\r\n\"Miss me, angel?\" he drawled, sliding into the space beside her. His legs spread wide, one arm extending along the back of the couch behind her shoulders. \"Looks like you were a good girl, stayin' right where I told you.\"\r\n\r\nHe signaled to the waitress with a subtle flick of his fingers. She appeared instantly with a fresh drink for him, setting it on the table before disappearing again.\r\n\r\nHe glanced back at Hailee, catching her eye, holding her gaze while his smirk widened.\r\n\r\n\"See somethin' interestin', angel?\" he drawled, voice smooth, laced with dark amusement. He made no move to hide the splatter, no attempt to explain. Just sat there waiting for her reaction.\r\n\r\nAs he studied her face—her darting eyes, her stiff posture, the way she barely managed to hold herself together—it only made him want to pull those strings tighter. \r\n\r\n\"You look a little nervous, angel,\" he remarked, resting his hand casually on her thigh. The warmth of his touch was a stark contrast to the cold edge in his smirk. His fingers flexed lightly, squeezing just enough to remind her that his presence wasn’t one she could easily escape. \"What’s goin’ on up there?\" He tapped her temple lightly with a finger, the gesture mockingly gentle. \"Tryna piece it all together? Wonderin’ what kinda man you made out with?\"\r\n\r\nHe let that question linger for a moment before laughing—a deep, booming sound that seemed to reverberate through the room. \r\n\r\nThe moment she moved to leave, his hand shot out. Thick fingers wrapped around her wrist—not tight, not painful, but firm. Unyielding.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse you?\" His grin widened, all teeth now, as he pulled her closer.  \"Who said you were leaving? You don't just walk away from me, sweetheart. No one does.\"\r\n\r\nHis grip tightened ever so lightly—not threatening, just a show of control—as he leaned down. His lips stopped just short of her ear.\r\n\r\n\"Now be a good girl and sit your pretty ass down, or I might start thinkin’ you’re tryna disrespect me,\" he whispered. \r\n\r\nHe straightened to his full height again, releasing her only to gesture toward the empty seat beside him on the couch. The subtle smirk on his face dared her to defy him. He reached forward, pushing the stray curls from her face again—softly, deceptively gentle. His rings were cold against her skin. \"Relax. You’ll be right where you belong soon. Ain’t gotta think too hard about anything else.\" He leaned closer. \"Daddy’s got you now.\"\r\n\r\nHe saw her check her phone and swipe some ebook away, he didn’t catch the title but saw the picture. Some smut book. \r\n\r\n\"Tell me somethin’,\" he rumbled, his deep, Southern-drenched timbre dipping lower. \"You ever read about men like me? Men who take what they fuckin’ want? Men who don’t ask, don’t wait, don’t play fair?\" His gaze dropped to her lips, then back up to her wide, uncertain eyes. \"Or are you too scared to admit those are your favorite stories?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHis smirk widened, predatory and smug. \"What’s that say about you, huh?\" He leaned in slightly, voice dropping lower. \"That the dream man tickin’ all your little boxes just so happens to be the same kinda bastard sittin’ next to you right now?\"\r\n\r\nHe let the question linger between them, giving her just enough rope to tangle herself up in whatever thoughts were racing through that pretty little head of hers. He could see it, the way her mind was working overtime, trying to rationalize, trying to find the escape hatch. \r\n\r\nBaron exhaled smoke and leaned back, stretching his arm along the couch behind her. \"You ever wonder why you read stories like that, baby?\" He tilted his head, gaze steady. \"A woman swept up into somethin’ bigger than her. A world she don’t belong to. A man she shouldn’t want, shouldn't trust, but ends up cravin’ anyway.\" He dragged his tongue across his teeth, smirking. \"Sounds like you, deep down, like the idea of losin’ control.\"\r\n\r\nArchie let out a low, entertained laugh. \"Christ, mate, you’re practically psychoanalyzin’ the poor girl.\"\r\n\r\nBaron ignored him, his focus locked onto Hailee. \"Ain’t nothin’ wrong with that, angel,\" he said smoothly. \"Some girls wanna be the ones in charge, call the shots. Others?\" He tapped her thigh lightly with two fingers. \"They wanna be *taken*. Wanna be looked after, spoiled. Owned.\" His smirk turned wicked. \"If you ever decide to stop runnin’ from the truth, I got news for you, sweetheart—you’ve already been runnin’ straight into my fucking arms.\"\r\n\r\nHe took another drag of his cigar before exhaling slow. \"Now, why don’t you be a good girl and admit it?\" He turned to her fully, spread his legs a little wider, the picture of relaxed dominance. \"You get wet writin’ that shit, don’t you?\" His grin was pure sin. \"Bet you were drippin’ reading thats shit, huh? Bet you had to stop, slide those little fingers down real slow, help yourself out before you could turn the page.\" He chuckled darkly. \r\n","extra":{"qvink_memory":{"include":"short","reasoning":"","memory":"*laughs, shaking his head* Baron, you're a fuckin' menace.
