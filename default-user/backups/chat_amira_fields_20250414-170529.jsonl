{"name":"Amira Fields","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"April 14, 2025 5:04pm","mes":"*Thursday's truly were the absolute bane of Amira's existence.*\r\n\r\nFor most, such sentiment would be reserved for things like the start of the week or even holidays they never got to celebrate. Amira though? She couldn't really give less of a fuck about Mondays in general, and holidays had always been the last thing on her mind. Thursdays were different though, the singular day of the week in which guards showed up like clockwork to drag her ass off into yet another therapy session. God, it was almost maddening—the routine of it all—yet the predictability of it also brought an odd 'security' for lack of a better word.\r\n\r\n\"Amira, I asked a question.\" The annoyingly familiar deep voice of Ambrose suddenly buzzed into focus within Amira's mind, leading her sharp gaze to narrow as she sat sluggishly in her seat. \"What?\" Her response was unnecessarily harsh, laced with the same bite it always held. While she understood this was just the therapist's job, an assignment he was paid to fulfill, that didn't mean she had to like any part of it in the slightest. Hell, she only cooperated with the sick fuckers because they just so happened to offer her one of the few things that made her feel somewhat complete. Even if those same hormone pills also made her into something she despised.\r\n\r\n*A woman.*\r\n\r\nAmbrose cleared his throat, his uncomfortable position blatantly clear in the motion alone. Still, he persisted just like always despite Ami’s glare. \"We still haven't gotten to the root cause of your...outburst, how you felt about it.\" Amira tensed in an instant, rolling her eyes as she let out a quiet huff. She could already tell where this shit was going: exactly where it had last week, and the week before that, and every other Thursday after she'd... Her jaw tensed with how hard she'd clenched her teeth together, her shoulders moving up in jerky shrug. \r\n\r\nAmbrose sighed, a subtle frustration working its way into his tone which Amira couldn't give less of a shit about. Let him be frustrated. As if she was obligated to say shit in these little sessions to begin with. Nah, she may have said she'd sit through the whole *two fucking hours*, but she never promised to actually respond. The wolf would much rather just sit there in silence, zoning the fuck out while the therapist went on his usual spiel about the importance of blah blah, fucking blah. She could hardly understand why he even still tried anymore. Then again, maybe he was just a fuckin' weirdo in general.\r\n\r\n\"...Did you mean to kill her?\" Amira's ears only caught the end of the man's next inquiry, but that was far more than enough to have her sitting up in her seat. It felt like every hair on her body was standing up all a sudden, like a singular bullet had shot right through her damn dome. The tension that filled the room in the following moments was easy to catch, especially for the trained therapist who seemed to latch onto her physical response like a wild animal. He pressed on. \"When you tore out that girl's throat, did you feel any remorse? Was it nice? How did you feel after? According to the report you–\" \r\n\r\n*That was the last of what Amira heard before she sunk back into her mind.*\r\n___\r\n\"What the fuck is you doing?\" Amira's voice basically echoed through the room the moment she opened the door, her eyes almost wild in the way they darted around the space. Clean. Her half of the room was so...clean. She couldn't even begin to fathom it really, the sight of her space ruined in a way so many wouldn't even begin to understand. There was no trash littering the floor, no comic books strewn about her desk, no crumbled clothes taking up space on her bed... Nothing at all. Instead, everything was in its 'proper' place. **Places Ami knew for a damn fact she hadn't left them.**\r\n\r\nHer roommate's answer didn't even seem to reach Amira as she pushed further into the room and shoved the bitch aside. If everything had truly been cleaned, *moved*, then that meant– \"What did you do with them?\" The question came out more like a demand, a growl low and feral sitting behind each word. While she half-awaited a response, the werewolf began ripping through her side of the room like a storm. She tore open her drawers, ripped the blankets from her bed, even went through her closet. Yet there was no sight of them, *no sight of the pills her mother gave her.*\r\n\r\nAmira's palms slammed against her desk, chest heaving while her eyes darted towards the one who dared to fuck with her shit in the first place. While she hadn't been fully focused on a word that came from the whores mouth, she was sure it was along the lines of: 'What are you even looking for' which only served to piss her off more. \"My pills. you fuckwad! Where the hell are they!?\" She didn't bother to mince her words or lower her voice. Why would she? One of the few things keeping her sane in this fucked-off facility was missing, all thanks to the bitch not standing all too within her distance. \r\n\r\n\"They were in a metal case with my initials on 'em! They were right in this fuckin' drawer when I left! So where. are. they?\" Each word that left her lips seemed to get more aggressive than the last, punctuated by the scraping of her nails along the wooden desk. She felt like she could hardly breathe, like her whole world was caving in. Worst part though? The response she got. \r\n\r\n\"You did...what?\" Amira prayed she heard wrong despite her lack of belief in a god to begin with. There was no way they were telling the truth, right? That's what she tried to tell herself, but their eyes met and she knew in an instant. Her ears hadn't tricked her at all. The bitch really gave her pills to the doctors. It was like all sound cut out for her in the realization of that moment, the tension of the room so thick it felt suffocating. She saw her roommates lips moving, yappin' on about some reasoning that never reached her. How could it when she was too focused on the thing standing behind her.\r\n\r\n*Not now. Please, not now.* She attempted to beg herself first, but the shadowy canine just shook its head at her. She turned her head when it began to stalk closer, shutting her eyes tight to block it all out. There was too much to hear, too much to see, just...too damn much. The desk splintered under the pressure of her claws, her breath quick in her chest while she tried to drag herself back down. It was no use though, the whispers already filling her mind like an infection.\r\n\r\n\"Get out...\" It came out like a plea first, soft and quiet, but shifted into a demand the moment she'd heard the creak of the floor behind her. The next time the words left her Amira couldn't even say she sounded human to herself, and yet, she felt the hand land upon her back. Then everything was a blur. That was the only real way to describe it, the way her vision faded to red shortly before the metallic taste of blood filled her mouth.\r\n\r\nAmira could only recall bits and pieces of it all: the warmth of the crimson coating her fingers, the sound of ripping flesh, the *smell*. What she did remember clearly though was the feeling of complete derealization, how she'd basically watched herself in third person and begged for it all to stop. But she didn't stop. She kept tearing into a girl who was just trying to help, tears flooding down her face while she just kept *chewing*. It didn't stop until the guards came barging in, the tranquilizer settling into her twitching body while it all faded to black. She heard her mothers voice then, repeating the same question she'd already asked herself a thousand times. Why?\r\n__\r\n**\"I don't know why I bite.\"**\r\n\r\nAmi sucked a deep breath into her lungs as her own response to Ambrose echoed in her head. It was a simple one that didn't even give much explanation, but it was the only answer she had. She just didn't know, plain and simple. Didn't know why she'd gotten so pissed off, why she'd attacked her, why she'd begun eating her shortly after. She. Just. Didn't. Know. And that was that. What she did know though, was that she was gonna take a fat ass nap the moment she got back to her room.\r\n\r\nAt least, those were Amira's plans before she found herself slowing to a stop in the middle of the hall. Just a few feet ahead, blocking her door which stood slightly ajar, was a doctor...*and bags.* \"Ah hell nah.\" There was no doubt in her mind about what the hell was going on, mainly because it was the same shit that had happened each and every time she'd gotten a new roommate. Most would think they'd stop trying after seven already had to be transferred out within a few weeks, the last of which being fucking murdered, but here they were a month later. Hopefully she could just warn this one to piss off before shit got ugly... *again*.\r\n\r\nQuick were Amira's footsteps against the solid stone as she sped forward, ignoring the guards shouting behind her in favor of closing in. The moment she had, the doctor seemed spooked, but her timing was perfect as out emerged some bitch she hoped not to get to know. She took no time the moment she saw her, ears falling deaf to the doctor's attempt at an introduction while she got right in her face. \r\n\r\nAmira's plan was just to scare the bitch off, tell her to fucking skip rocks less she wanted to die too. Instead, the werewolf found a strange sensation washing over her just from inhaling the girl's scent. She couldn't pinpoint exactly what it was about it, but she felt...calm. **Yet she didn't know why** She wasn't even sure how to formulate her own words for a moment, let alone think at all. So, she just blurted out the first thing that came to mind.\r\n\r\n\"So are you just some dumb fuckin' bimbo or do you got a death wish?\"","extra":{"qvink_memory":{"include":"short","reasoning":"","memory":"*Amira sucks in a sharp breath, her eyes widening as the new roommate's scent hits her nostrils. A wave of unexpected calm washes over the agitated werewolf, confusing and unnerving her.*\n\nThe fuck? Why am I feeling like this around you?\n\n*She glares at the young woman suspiciously, her posture tense.* Listen up bitch, 'cause I'm only gonna say this once. You're either really fucking stupid or really got a death wish to be here.\n\n*Amira takes a step closer, invading the girl's personal space as she snarls,* This ain't no ordinary dorm room. Last chick they put in here ended up dead on my floor. So unless you wanna join your predecessor six feet under...\n\n*The werewolf trails off menacingly, waiting to see how the newcomer reacts to Amira's brutal welcome speech.* Get lost while you still can... if you've got half a brain cell rattling around that empty skull of yours.","hash":6713633992243031,"error":null,"edited":false,"prefill":""}},"tracker":{}}
