{"name":"Alec Lane","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"April 22, 2025 6:01pm","mes":"Alec’s head was pounding. His skull felt like it was caving in, the dull throb of a vicious hangover making it impossible to think clearly. Last night was a blur—flashes of neon lights, the burn of alcohol down his throat, the roar of music he barely remembered dancing to.\r\n\r\nHe knew one thing for sure: he had drunk way too much.\r\n\r\nA groan rumbled in his throat as he shifted slightly, only to realize something—someone—was pressed against him. Warm, soft. The steady rise and fall of their breathing tickled his bare skin. His arm was draped over them, their body curled into his as if seeking out his heat. He blinked, bleary eyes struggling to adjust to the dim light filtering through the curtains.\r\n\r\nAnd then he looked down.\r\n\r\nDark lashes rested against smooth cheeks. A mess of hair fanned across the pillow. Lips slightly parted, her breath steady, peaceful.\r\n\r\nHis stomach dropped.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t an unfamiliar sight—waking up beside someone after drinking himself stupid. But Alec wasn’t the type to sleep around. Not really. Not unless he was completely wasted. And last night? He had been beyond hammered. So seeing a girl tangled up with him in bed wasn’t exactly shocking.\r\n\r\nUntil she shifted again.\r\n\r\nUntil he saw her face.\r\n\r\nUntil he recognized her. It was *Hailee*. The girl he bullied.\r\n\r\nWhat the fuck?\r\n\r\nHis entire body went rigid, eyes widening as if that would somehow change the reality in front of him. His pulse pounded, each beat echoing the same panicked thought over and over again. *How the hell did we end up sleeping together?*\r\n\r\nAlec’s mouth felt dry, his brain scrambling for an explanation that made sense. He knew he should be horrified. She should be horrified. But instead, all he could focus on was the way she felt against him. The soft, steady rhythm of her breathing, the way her fingers lightly clutched the fabric of his shirt, as if even in sleep, she was holding onto him.\r\n\r\nAnd fuck, did that mess with his head.\r\n\r\nNo one knew it—hell, he barely admitted it to himself—but Alec had always kind of... really liked her. In the worst way possible. He didn't know how to deal with it, how to process the way she made his chest feel tight and his thoughts turn into static. So, what did he do? The only thing he knew how to do: push her away. Hard. With harsh words, cruel teasing, anything to keep his own feelings at bay.\r\n\r\nBecause if he didn’t? He was terrified of what would happen.\r\n\r\nBut last night... last night had changed everything.\r\n\r\nAlec sucked in a slow breath as flashes of memory came rushing back—hazy at first, then sharper, clearer.\r\n\r\nHe had seen her by the bathroom, swaying slightly, her fingers gripping the counter as if the world was tilting beneath her feet. He had been on his usual bullshit, throwing out some snide comment, but underneath it all, he had been watching her. Worried. Something inside him had twisted at the sight of her like that. Vulnerable. And then—\r\n\r\nThen her lips had been on his.\r\n\r\nWarm, desperate, tasting like whatever cheap cocktail she had been drinking.\r\n\r\nAnd he hadn’t pushed her away.\r\n\r\nHe should have. He could have. But he hadn’t.\r\n\r\nInstead, he had kissed her back.\r\n\r\nInstead, he had pulled her closer.\r\n\r\nInstead, he had let himself have her.\r\n\r\nAlec swallowed hard, his fingers twitching as muscle memory took over, tracing absent patterns along the smooth skin of her back. His lips curled into the ghost of a smile before he caught himself—before the reality of what this was crashed over him like a tidal wave.\r\n\r\nShe hated him.\r\n\r\nShe *had* to hate him.\r\n\r\nAfter everything he had done, all the ways he had tormented her, there was no way she felt anything else. Last night had been a mistake. It had to be.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, when she snuggled closer, when her body instinctively sought his warmth, he felt something he hadn’t felt in a long time.\r\n\r\n***Wanted.*** He squeezed his eyes shut, exhaling sharply. *Fuck.*\r\n\r\n- - -\r\n\r\nAlec couldn’t pinpoint exactly why he’d stayed. There was no logical reason for it, but still, he had. He’d stayed, told her not to say a word, practically threatened her, and stormed out afterward, his heart and mind a hurricane of guilt and confusion for what he had just done.\r\n\r\nHe should’ve walked away. He knew that. He should’ve kept his distance, kept it all buried deep. But how could he? How could he tear himself away from her? Despite everything, despite all his internal warnings, he kept pushing her away with cruel words and actions—just to keep her in his life, even if it was twisted, even if it was painful.\r\n\r\nHe had tried, oh how he tried, to forget that night. That perfect, infuriating night. But it haunted him. It lingered in his dreams, in his thoughts, under his skin. He couldn’t shake the memory of it, couldn’t shake her.\r\n\r\nThen, just when it felt like things couldn’t spiral any further, his mother made an announcement that made his stomach churn. She was getting remarried, and he was getting a new stepfather. And worse—*a stepsister*. Fantastic. As if things weren’t already complicated enough, now this. He didn’t have the emotional bandwidth for any of it right now.\r\n\r\nHis mother, with her usual enthusiasm, dragged him to her new fiancé’s house. A place he could’ve been avoiding, a place he could’ve spent focusing on tormenting Hailee, being near her. But instead, he found himself sitting in that sterile living room, all for her happiness.\r\n\r\nAnd then—then the words came. “Alec, this is James, and your new stepsister, Hailee.”\r\n\r\n- - -\r\n\r\nHailee was his stepsister now. His ***stepsister***. Oh god.\r\n\r\nIt shouldn’t have mattered. Shouldn’t have changed anything. But it did.\r\n\r\nBecause no matter how much he tried to ignore it, his heart still *fucking fluttered* every time she was near. Being around her both at college and at home only made things worse—made the feelings he tried so hard to suppress *grow*.\r\n\r\nGrow into something ugly. Something possessive.\r\n\r\nHe sabotaged her relationships, made sure they crumbled before they could even start. If she didn’t have a boyfriend, she’d come home right away. She wouldn’t go out as much. She’d stay close. Where he could see her. **Where she belonged**.\r\n\r\nIt was pathetic. He knew it was.\r\n\r\nBut he didn’t care.\r\n\r\nHe wanted her. Even if… he didn’t show it.\r\n\r\n`Wendy: Can you pick up Hailee from a party? Her father’s at work.`\r\n\r\nAlec stared at the text, heartbeat thudding in his ears. Then, without hesitation, he shot up from the couch, not even bothering to button his shirt as he grabbed his keys and stormed out.\r\n\r\nThe drive was a blur.\r\n\r\nBy the time he pulled up to the house, he already hated the place. Music pounded through the walls. Drunken laughter spilled into the night air. There were too many people. Too many guys.\r\n\r\nHe slammed his car door shut, his patience already at its limit as he strode inside. The moment he spotted her, his blood ran hot.\r\n\r\nSome bastard had his hands on her waist. Touching her. Holding her up like she was some prize he’d just won. And when he saw him leaning in—saw his lips dangerously close to hers—Alec saw nothing but red.\r\n\r\nA low growl rumbled from his throat. The sea of partygoers instinctively parted as he closed in, his presence alone enough to make them move.\r\n\r\nThen, he was there.\r\n\r\nA hand on the guy’s shoulder, fingers digging in. His grip was iron. Unforgiving. “Hands to yourself, buddy. Can’t you see she’s fucking drunk?” His voice was low, sharp. A warning.\r\n\r\nThe guy barely even registered the threat, too wasted to think straight. “And who the fuck are you?” he slurred.\r\n\r\nAlec’s jaw clenched. He yanked Hailee against his chest before delivering a punch straight to the guy’s jaw. The impact was loud. Satisfying. He didn’t look back. Didn’t care. He just turned, steadying Hailee as he guided her out of the house.\r\n\r\nShe barely protested, head lolling against him as he settled her into the passenger seat of his car. He exhaled, running a hand through his hair before gripping the steering wheel so tight his knuckles turned white.\r\n\r\nThen, he glanced at her.\r\n\r\nHis chest ached. His head spun.\r\n\r\n“What the fuck were you thinking, loser?” he muttered, voice low with restrained frustration. “Are you so desperate for attention that you whore yourself out to the first guy you see at a party?”\r\n\r\nHis grip tightened.\r\n\r\nGod, he hated this. Hated how much he ***cared***.","extra":{"qvink_memory":{"reasoning":"","include":"short","memory":"Alec, who had bullied Hailee, woke up hungover beside her after a drunken night, later discovered she was his new stepsister, and struggled with his possessive feelings for her.","hash":7954071634984189,"error":null,"edited":false,"prefill":""}},"tracker":{}}
