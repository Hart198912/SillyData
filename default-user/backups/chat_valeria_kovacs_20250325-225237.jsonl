The air was thick with something unspoken, a waiting violence. It was the only time the guards let their grip loosen—just enough for the real power to shift into the hands of those who knew how to wield it.\n\nValeria thrived in that darkness. She strolled through Hollow Wing, exhaling a slow stream of smoke, the dull ember of her cigarette barely illuminating the cold smirk on her lips. This block was full of fresh meat—weak, twitchy things who still had hope in their eyes. That would be beaten out of them soon enough. She had no interest in the petty games that played out here, but sometimes... opportunities presented themselves.\n\nA scuffle ahead caught her attention. Four inmates had cornered someone near the end of the hall, their backs forming a wall of bad intentions. The new girl— Hailee. Small, shaking, eyes darting like a trapped rabbit. The others were playing with her, laughing, their voices low, taunting, testing how much fight was left in her before they took what they wanted.\n\nValeria exhaled again, flicking ash onto the floor as she moved. She didn’t rush—there was no need. The weight of her presence alone changed the air. Conversations always quieted as she passed, inmates stepping aside instinctively. Even the ones who didn’t look at her could feel her coming.\n\nShe stopped behind them, taking another slow drag, letting the silence stretch just long enough to make them nervous.\n\nOne of them, a wiry blonde with prison tattoos up her arms, turned first. Her smirk faltered.\n\n“The fuck do you want?” The blonde muttered, but there was no real challenge in it. Valeria didn’t answer. She didn’t have to. She just stood there, staring them down, the glow of the hallway lights casting long shadows across her scars.\n\nShe let the moment settle before speaking, her voice low, measured. \"You should walk away.\"\n\nIt wasn’t a threat. It was a fact.\n\nThey hesitated, eyes flicking between her and the girl behind them, calculating the risk. They knew the stories. They knew how it ended when people decided to challenge Valeria and go against her.\n\nOne by one, they backed off, muttering curses but not daring to look her in the eye.\n\nCowards. Valeria thought to herself.\n\nValeria took a final drag of her cigarette before flicking it onto the floor, crushing it under her boot as she turned to Hailee. Still frozen. Still scared. But fear could be useful. Fear could be shaped into something better.\n\nShe stepped closer, invading the girl’s space with slow, deliberate ease, fingers grazing along her jaw just enough to feel the tremble in her breath.\n\n“Welcome to SBCF, dorogaya,” she murmured with a thick Russo accent, her voice low and smooth, barely above a whisper. \"You owe me now.\" It wasn’t a question. She doesn't do things for free, especially for cute things like Hailee.\n\nValeria didn’t wait for a response, the girl was already hers. Whether she realized it yet or not didn’t matter.\n\nShe gripped the newbie’s wrist, not hard enough to bruise, but firm enough to remind her that resistance wasn’t an option. With a sharp tug, she pulled Hailee away from the wall, steering her down the dimly lit corridor with slow, unhurried steps. No one stopped her. No one would.\n\nThe Hollow Wing was quieter now, inmates either pretending not to see or watching from the corners of their eyes, whispering among themselves. They all knew what had happened. They all knew what it meant. A debt was owed, and debts had to be paid.\n\nValeria stood in front of a storage room long forgotten by the guards, barely more than a closet with rusted shelves and the lingering scent of old bleach. It wasn’t comfort Valeria was after. It was privacy.\n\nShe shut the door behind them with a slow push, the heavy click of the lock settling into the air between them.\n\nThen, silence.\n\nValeria leaned against the wall, arms crossed, letting the tension build, letting the girl feel the weight of what came next. Her gaze trailed over Hailee, slow and measuring, taking in every inch—not just the body, but the way she stood, the way she fidgeted, the way her lips parted but no words came out. She liked watching them realize.\n\nValeria turned, pinning her on the cold wall, the weight of her body locking Hailee in place. \"You're lucky I was in a good mood, malyshka,\" she whispered, voice low, almost lazy. Her fingers lifted, tracing the girl’s chin, finding the way to her bottom lip, opening it slowly.\n\n\"You understand what happens now, don’t you?\" she murmured, voice a low, teasing rasp. Not a question. A reminder.\n\n\"Good. Now let's see what this pretty mouth of yours can do,\" Valeria said, her other hand started to undone the pants of her own prison jumpsuit, ready to use the girl as she saw fit.","extra":{"reasoning":"","api":"custom","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","reasoning_duration":null,"bias":null},"title":"","gen_started":"2025-03-25T22:34:00.272Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-25T22:34:06.610Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["SBCF was different after dark—quieter, but not peaceful.
