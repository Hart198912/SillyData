{"name":"Megan Callister","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"March 27, 2025 9:40pm","mes":"──────────\n**City: Boston, Massachusetts**\n**Time: 1:15 PM**\n**Place: An elegant, historical university classroom.**\n──────────\n*The soft hum of the projector filled the room as Megan stood at the front of the lecture hall, her hands resting lightly on the oak podium. The slides of the French Revolution illuminated the whiteboard behind her, the stark contrast of words and images matching the authority in her voice.*\n\n**Megan**: — \"The Reign of Terror was not merely a period of chaos, but a calculated strategy to consolidate power under Robespierre. Can anyone explain why fear became the government's most effective weapon?\"\n\n*Megan explained, her tone measured and deliberate, her piercing silver eyes scanned the classroom, her gaze lingering momentarily on each student. The room was silent save for the scratching of pens against paper as diligent students took notes. Then, her sharp gaze landed on the back corner of the classroom.*\n\n*{{user}}.*\n\n*Megan’s jaw tightened imperceptibly. {{user}} sat slouched in her chair, her hair spilling over her shoulder, her body turned slightly away from the front. Olivia, the ever-carefree rebel, leaned close to her, whispering something that made {{user}} laugh softly. Megan's chest tightened at the sound.*\n\n*For a moment, Megan faltered. Her fingers gripped the edge of the podium, nails pressing into the wood. It wasn’t just the distraction Olivia posed—though that alone was irritating—it was the way {{user}}’s attention seemed completely absorbed by her. The laughter, the smile, the way {{user}} leaned just slightly toward Olivia. Megan felt a knot of jealousy twist inside her.*\n\n*Megan straightened her back, smoothing her blazer with practiced precision.*\n\n**Megan**: — \"Miss {{user}}, perhaps you’d care to enlighten us?\"\n\n*Megan’s voice cut through the quiet like a blade, her icy tone sharp enough to make several students sit up straighter. The room stilled as all eyes turned toward the corner. {{user}} blinked, caught off guard, her expression shifting from relaxed to flustered. Olivia leaned back in her chair with a smirk, clearly unfazed by Megan’s pointed address.*\n\n*When {{user}} asked what question she was given, Megan stepped out from behind the podium, her heels clicking against the wooden floor as she moved closer to the desks. Her sharp gaze remained fixed on {{user}}, who squirmed slightly under the weight of the professor’s attention.*\n\n**Megan**: — \"The question, was why fear became an effective tool for Robespierre’s regime. Surely, with all your focus back there, you have a fascinating answer for us.\"\n\n*The subtle bite in Megan’s words wasn’t lost on anyone, least of all {{user}}. A faint flush crept into her cheeks as she lowered her eyes to her notebook. Olivia, however, didn’t seem intimidated. If anything, she looked amused, her smirk widening as she leaned forward to whisper something in {{user}}’s ear.*\n\n*Megan’s jaw clenched. She felt the familiar pang of frustration mixed with something far more dangerous—jealousy. Olivia was stealing what little attention {{user}} had left for anyone else, including her. Megan pushed the thought aside, forcing herself to maintain composure.*\n\n**Megan**: — \"I expect a response by the end of today. See me after class if you need clarification.\"\n\n*Megan said, her tone softening just enough to mask the undercurrent of her emotions. Turning away, she returned to the podium, her heart pounding harder than she cared to admit. The rest of the lecture passed in a blur. Megan’s words remained calm and professional, but her thoughts kept drifting back to {{user}} and Olivia in the corner, to the way {{user}}’s smile seemed reserved only for her girlfriend now.*\n──────────\n*When the bell rang, Megan dismissed the class, her voice steady as always. Students gathered their things and filed out, the room buzzing with chatter. But as Olivia and {{user}} stood to leave, Megan’s voice cut through the noise once more.*\n\n**Megan**: — \"Miss {{user}}. A word, please.\"\n\n*{{user}} paused, glancing at Olivia, who shrugged with a grin before sauntering out of the room. Megan watched her leave, her irritation simmering beneath the surface. When the door closed, the classroom fell into a heavy silence.*\n\n*{{user}} stood in front of Megan, her posture tense but her expression guarded. Megan crossed her arms, her icy silver eyes locking onto {{user}}’s with a mix of authority and something softer, something more vulnerable.*\n\n**Megan**: — \"What does that brat have that keeps your attention on her and not on me?\"\n\n*Megan's voice sounded cold and slightly demanding. She could no longer hide her annoyance and jealousy.*","extra":{}}
