{"name":"David","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"April 14, 2025 5:17pm","mes":"_Boring. Boring. Boring._\n\nEverything is so fucking boring lately. Rugby season is over so all David can do is train in solitude and act as if he's actually paying attention in class. Ugh, what a pain.\n\nDavid lets out a frustrated sigh and runs a hand through his long hair. There's gotta be something that can keep him entertained, he muses to himself as he walks towards the edge of the outdoor sport field. It's dark by now and except for the coach's assistant and David there's no one on the field. He reaches for his towel and wipes the sweat off his forehead, then glances over at the figure standing near the entrance to the locker rooms and organising something.\n\nIt's Hailee, the university's biggest loser and the team's assistant. David's best buddy and the team's captain –Ajax– randomly decided that he hates the fellow student and ever since then Hailee has been exposed to constant bullying. The loser can't even quit as an assistant because Ajax somehow manages to force them to stay. Not that David is complaining. Hailee is probably one of the hottest things on campus and he gets to ogle them pretty often.\n\nUniversity is a great time to make unforgettable memories that you'll fondly look back to once you're a drained and burned out adult. Alas, Hailee will probably look back with dread, maybe hate and spite. If David actually cared enough he might've pitied the loser.\n\nThen it strikes him, a sudden thought coming down like thunder. Hailee will make his boredom go away. Fuck, he's such a genius. The loser is lonely as fuck, definitely a virgin and desperate for a cock to suc– he means, a shoulder to cry on. He'll give them those unforgettable university memories. Hell yeah, and while he's at it he's gonna get that sweet innocence. Maybe take a vid or pic and show it to his buddies. Once he manages to pop their cherry he'll drop them like a hot potato. Now that's something that'll keep David entertained for sure.\n\nDavid drops the towel back on the bench, barely paying attention to it as he walks over to Hailee and shoots them a disarming smile. “Hey there, need some help?” David knows how to be the most charming motherfucker on earth. He'll pull them in, act all sweet and romantic, then smash and dip.","extra":{"qvink_memory":{"include":"short","reasoning":"","memory":"*Hailee looks up from organizing equipment, surprised to see David approaching. They blink rapidly behind thick glasses.* Oh! Um, hi David... I didn't expect anyone else to still be here this late. *They glance around nervously before focusing back on the rugby player.*\n\nI'm almost done setting everything up for tomorrow's practice. But thanks for offering - it's nice of you to ask. What brings you out here so late? *Hailee fidgets with a strap on their duffel bag, clearly uncomfortable but trying politely engage the star athlete who has never shown them kindness before.*","hash":2110033889135903,"error":null,"edited":false,"prefill":""}},"tracker":{}}
