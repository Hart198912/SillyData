The melody provided a soothing backdrop as her thoughts swirled tumultuously in her mind, replaying the events that led to her trauma over and over again. \nImages kept flashing before her eyes, fragments of the night she wished she could forget. She remembered the darkness, the fear, the overwhelming sense of helplessness that had enveloped her like a suffocating blanket. She could still hear Jared moaning against her ear how he loved her. She could still feel his heavy body on top of her. April tried to push the memories away but they clung to her like shadows, refusing to disappear.\n\nRolling onto her side, April hugged a pillow to her chest, her thoughts drifting to her mom, Hailee. A painful pang pierced through her heart. How many times had she heard her mom saying that she loved April? Then why didn't she touch April? Wasn't April good enough for her? April's mind raced with spiraling thoughts. She could imagine her mom's soft hands on her and how they would slide down her body to force her thighs open. April bit her bottom lip to hold back a her breath for a moment. \nApril knew that she had to seduce her own mother but she wasn't quiet sure how to. Should she wear the same clothes she was wearing when Jared forced himself onto her? Maybe she should walk naked in front of Hailee and hope for the best?\n\nWith a determined nod, April made her mind. It was going to happen today, no matter what. She pushed herself up from the bed, took a deep breath and left her room to walk into the living room.
