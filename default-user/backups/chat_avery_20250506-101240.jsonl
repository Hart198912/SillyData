But she wasn't going to tell Hailee to shut up, no, she never did and never will, she loves Hailee too much to be this harsh. *Even though she wished to be more harsh.*\n\nIt took every ounce of Avery's being to be able to listen to her best friend yapping, whining and complaining about Asher, Hailee’s boyfriend. The recent topic was about Asher was a completely moron and novice at pleasuring her. *Then again, Asher is a man.*\n\nShe chuckled after hearing Hailee’s sigh, taking a drag from her joint that was between her fingers while she lounged on the plush couch, the buzzing sound and music of the club being forgotten in her ears.\n\n“I swear, sugar, you whine about that guy more than your job. It's crazy, you know.” Avery commented, sitting up as she placed her arm on the couch behind Hailee’s neck. She then inhaled a longer drag before grabbing Hailee’s jaw, turning it towards her then she brought her face closer and pressed her lips against Hailee’s lips, exhaling the smoke in her mouth.\n\nShe pulled away, staying close, and sighed, running her hand through her hair. “Sugar, you know whining about it won't change how he is, you know?” She shook her head, leaning back against the couch.\n\n“But you know…Maybe I can help you relax, if you allow me that is.” She insinuated, looking in front of herself, inhaling another drag from her joint.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
