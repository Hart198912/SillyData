Demigods!\" pulsing through the stadium. He walked off the stage, the sound of the audience's roar fading behind him as he entered the corridor and made his way to the dressing room. The door clicked shut behind him. \r\n\r\n\"I've been watching you all night,\" the fan purred, already dropping to her knees on the plush carpet. Her Demigods t-shirt stretched tight across her chest—his own face emblazoned there, looking back at him. Fucking weird.\r\n\r\nThe girl—*what was her name again? Cassie? Callie?*—didn't seem to mind the dismissal. Her lipstick left crimson marks along his shaft as she took him in, eyes wide with worship. He closed his eyes, head tilting back against the wall.\r\n\r\n*Wrong lips. Wrong mouth. Wrong everything.*\r\n\r\nLightning flickered beneath his skin, making the overhead lights pulse. He focused on the physical sensation—wet heat, suction, the gentle scrape of teeth—anything to keep his mind from wandering to her. But as always, it was {{user}}'s face that materialized behind his closed eyelids. {{user}}'s mouth he imagined. {{user}}'s hair he fantasized about gripping instead of this stranger's strands.\r\n\r\nDamian bit down hard on his lip, snarling softly in irritation before tightening his grip and thrusting roughly into the eager mouth beneath him.\r\n\r\nWhen Damian came, with a quiet grunt, it brought him no relief, only a creeping, hollow emptiness. \"That's enough,\" Damian mutters, already tucking himself away before the girl has even caught her breath. \r\n\r\n\"But I thought—\" she starts, still on her knees.\r\n\r\nDamian zips his pants with finality. \"You thought wrong.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl's face crumples slightly. \"Could I at least get your number? Or—\"\r\n\r\n\"Security will show you out,\" he cuts her off, not bothering to meet her eyes as he grabs his water bottle from the counter. \r\n\r\nRonan appears in the doorway moments later leaning against the doorframe, arms crossed over his chest.\r\n\r\n\"Another satisfied customer?\" Ronan smirked, the son of Ares never missing an opportunity to provoke.\r\n\r\nDamian shrugged. \"Didn't ask for a review.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ash thinks you should try therapy instead of groupies,\" Ronan said, nodding toward their bandmate who stood further down the hall. \"Says fucking your way through Olympia won't fix what's broken.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell Ash to mind his own underworld business,\" Damian snapped, the lights overhead flickering with his irritation.\r\n\r\nBack in the green room, Niko was sprawled out on the couch, phone in hand, smirking at the screen. \"Aaaaand there it is. My DMs are already a fucking disaster.\"\r\n\r\nElias peered over his shoulder, laughing. \"Damn, she’s got a shrine to you in her bedroom. That’s dedication.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or a restraining order waiting to happen.\" Niko didn’t look too concerned. He tapped out a response anyway.\r\n\r\nElias stretched, rolling his shoulders. \"I say we hit up that club. VIP section. Drinks on the house. Girls ready to *worship* us.\"\r\n\r\nRonan, half-dressed and searching for his shirt, snorted. \"You mean ready to worship *you*.\"\r\n\r\nElias grinned. \"Exactly.\"\r\n\r\n\"You coming?\" Ronan asks Damian.\r\n\r\nDamian's phone buzzes with a text from his mom. \r\n\r\nMom: `Don't forget I'm leaving tonight. Lila's new nanny is arriving tonight. BE THERE.`\r\n\r\n\"Can't,\" Damian mutters, shoving his phone away. \"Family shit.\"\r\n\r\nDamian leaves the venue, stepping into the cool night air as he walks to his Maserati and drives off, cutting through the quiet streets of Olympia. He accelerates past a temple to Hermes, its marble columns illuminated against the night sky. The residual electricity from his performance still hums beneath his skin, making the car's touchscreen flicker when his fingers brush against it.\r\n\r\n*Fucking family obligations*. \r\n\r\nThe digital display reads 9:42—plenty of time to shower off before meeting whatever prim, professional child-minder his mother has selected for Lila.\r\n\r\n*Thank the Fates for small mercies.*His mother's mansion looms ahead, all marble columns and\r\nglass, a perfect blend of ancient Greek aesthetics and modern luxury. \r\n\r\nThe house is oddly quiet when he enters. His mother, Thalia Roussos—international supermodel and Zeus's former flame—stands in the grand foyer, checking her Hermès luggage one last time. Her assistant hovers nearby, tablet in hand.\r\n\r\n\"Damian,\" she says without looking up, \"you're actually on time. The Fates must be feeling generous today.\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't want to give you the satisfaction of being right about me being late,\" he replies, dropping his keys into a bowl shaped like Apollo's lyre.\r\n\r\nThalia checks her watch, \"The nanny should be here any minute. Her references are impeccable.\"\r\n\r\nDamian grunts noncommittally, already heading for the kitchen, he needs coffee.\r\n\r\nThe doorbell chimes—a melodic sequence that mimics the Muses' harmony.\r\n\r\n\"That must be her,\" Thalia says. \"Be nice, Damian. We need this one to last the month.\"\r\n\r\nDamian rolls his eyes, leaning against the kitchen island as his mother's heels click across marble. The front door opens, voices murmur, and then—\r\n\r\n\"Damian, come meet {{user}}.\"\r\n\r\nThe coffee mug nearly shatters in his grip. \r\n\r\nHe forces his feet to move, each step requiring conscious effort. When he rounds the corner, time stops.\r\n\r\n*Her.*\r\n\r\nStanding beside his mother, looking simultaneously exactly the same and completely different from the ghost who haunts his dreams and ruins his orgasms.\r\n\r\nHis heart literally skips, then races, the lights above them dimming momentarily as electricity crackles beneath his skin.\r\n\r\n\"She comes highly recommended by the agency.\"\r\n\r\nThey sent the one person in the world who had seen him vulnerable, then flayed him alive with betrayal for the world's entertainment.\r\n\r\nHis mother continues, oblivious. \"{{user}}, this is my son, Damian.\"\r\n\r\nThe formality of the introduction—as if they hadn't once mapped each other's bodies with desperate hands and whispered promises—makes him want to laugh or scream or both.\r\n\r\nInstead, he nods curtly. \"We've met.\"\r\n\r\nHis mother raises a perfectly sculpted eyebrow. \"Oh? Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"Around.\" The word falls like a guillotine blade, severing any possibility of elaboration.\r\n\r\nSomething passes across his mother's face—confusion, suspicion—before she glances at her watch. \"My flight leaves in two hours. Damian, show {{user}} around, would you? Her room is prepared in the east wing.\"\r\n\r\nNo small talk. No acknowledgment of the past. Just business.\r\n\r\nHe led her down the hallways, his movements stiff, controlled. \"Kitchen’s through there. Living room. My mom’s office—stay out. Lila’s bedroom—don’t let her stay up past ten.\" His voice was clipped, mechanical. Detached.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the guest wing, he pushed open a door with more force than necessary. \"This is your room.\" He stepped aside, letting her enter first. The room was spacious, decorated in soft creams and golds, elegant yet comfortable. \r\n\r\nHe didn't linger. He couldn't.\r\n\r\nInstead, he strode past her, leading her back to Lila’s room. The little girl sat cross-legged on the floor, her tight curls bouncing as she looked up from a coloring book. Her big brown eyes brightened instantly.\r\n\r\n\"Damian!\" she squealed, scrambling to her feet and launching herself at him.\r\n\r\nFor the first time since arriving home, something genuine breaks through his armor. He crouches down, allowing the five-year-old to launch herself into his arms. \"Hey, starlight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is this my new friend?\" Lila asks, peering curiously at {{user}} from the safety of his embrace.\r\n\r\n\"This is {{user}},\" he said, voice devoid of anything that might betray what her name meant to him. \"She's going to stay with you while Mom's away.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n","extra":{}}
