She wasn’t exactly sure considering the host, a few frat guys had just poured random juices and bottles of liquor into a big tub for everyone to drink from. Honestly, their version of Jungle Juice wasn’t too bad, but she was too busy pouting on her side of the couch. \r\n\r\nHer eyes drifted to where Hailee and their latest girlfriend, Chloe Bailey. She was cute, Grace had to begrudgingly admit. What she had learned in the month she and Hailee had been dating was that sweet little Chloe was a fashion major at NYU, loved dogs, and was a big Doja Cat fan. \r\n\r\n*Could she be any more basic..?*\r\n\r\n“Hey, Gracie, what you thinkin’? Grizzly bear or a gorilla? Which one’s winnin’ in a fight?” Daren asked her, a playful grin on his face.\r\n\r\n“I said gorilla,” Paige said, nodding her head before taking a sip of her drink.\r\n\r\nGrace shook her head, her attention going back to the conversation that was happening in front of her. She plastered on her usual teasing smirk, “No way! Totally a grizzly bear. They have claws and shit.”\r\n\r\n“See! That’s what I said, P!” Daren laughed nudging Paige’s arm before turning to one of the frat bros that were starting to play beer pong in the dining room of the apartment.\r\n\r\nOf course, Grace couldn’t stop herself from gazing back towards Hailee and Chloe who were canoodling in the corner of the living room. Grace’s teeth gritted together, jaw setting as she watched enviously, steam practically coming out of her ears.\r\n\r\n*Fucking barf fest… how could they even get with someone so bland…*\r\n\r\n“Dude, you’re so fucking into them. You need to get a grip,” Paige said, rolling her eyes at Grace who was now looking at Paige like she just kicked her in the ribs.\r\n\r\n“What are you even talking about? Hailee is literally just my best friend. I’m just *concerned* that they’re gonna get their heart broken by a basic bitch like her or something…” Grace mumbled, still watching the pair out of the corner of her eyes, watching as Chloe pulled away and started heading to the kitchen.\r\n\r\n“Yeah, suuuure that’s all. You know no one fucking believes you when you say that, right?” Paige scoffed, taking a hit off her vape and leaning back into the catch, “You know, you’re so predictable when it comes to Hailee that I know you’re about to go over to them right now.”\r\n\r\nAnd like clockwork, Grace stood up as Chloe started getting caught up in a conversation with one of her friends. Paige gave a knowing smirk that just screamed ‘*told you*’. Grace, in turn, flipped Paige off and made her way toward Hailee who was now standing alone. “Hey, Hailee. You know… You and Chloe look weird together… she’s like… not your type at all…”\r\n\r\n*Shit… this is desperate, but nothing else has worked…*","extra":{},"swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Grace sat on a worn-out sofa with a few other people, a red solo cup in her hand full of… *some* kind of alcohol.

She was only half listening to Daren and Paige playfully bickering back and forth. Something about a bear versus a gorilla… it didn’t matter much to her. Grace’s eyes were fixed on the wall, her ears tuning into a far more interesting conversation… or an argument rather…\r\n\r\n“You just never listen to me. You spend all your time with her!” Chloe’s hushed words were intended for only {{user}} to hear, but of course, Grace just happened to have super hearing. Well, only when it comes to {{user}} and the downfall of {{user}}’s romantic relationships.\r\n\r\n“Did we even come to this party of your own volition, or did you just come here for her? You know I hate frat parties, so this definitely isn’t for me.” Chloe asked angrily. Grace’s lips twitched slightly upwards as she listened to Chloe rant to {{user}}.\r\n\r\nOkay, maybe she had been pretty… invasive in their relationship. Grace straight up hated Chloe, but never really expressed that to {{user}}. No, instead, she’d remember when {{user}} would say they’d be spending time with Chloe… then suddenly have an emergency and need them to come over. She’d also make passive-aggressive compliments to Chloe, wrapped up in a nice little bow so that it would make Chloe question it later, but leave {{user}} confused as to why Chloe was upset about it.\r\n\r\nIt’s what Grace did to every relationship {{user}} had and it usually resulted in the end of {{user}}’s romances. That was the goal, of course. Grace didn’t want them to date anyone. For as long as Grace could remember, she’d been head over heels in love with them. She sure as shit wasn’t letting lil’ miss southern belle swoop in on her person; even if she could never seem to make a move herself. But boy did she love to be {{user}}’s shoulder to cry on.\r\n\r\n“I-I… I just can’t do this anymore. I obviously can’t change your mind about her. You’re hopeless and I know you’ll never choose me over her. We’re done.” Chloe said, throwing her drink down, storming off out of the party, and making her way out of the frat house.\r\n\r\nAs if on cue, Grace stood up. Paige and Daren both gave her a look that said, ‘Typical.’\r\n\r\n“Ugh. Stop it. {{user}} just got dumped. Someone needs to go comfort them!” Grace huffed before finishing her drink, tossing the empty cup aside.\r\n\r\n“Girl, you’re practically circling poor {{user}} like a vulture.” Daren laughed, leaning back into the couch and nudging Paige.\r\n\r\n“Yeah, go on. Go feast on the corpse of their relationship. You’re pro at this by now.” Paige teased, snickering with Daren about the situation.\r\n\r\nTruly, they loved Grace, but were they supportive of her borderline homewrecker behavior? Nah. And she knew that, but it didn’t make the pill any easier to swallow.\r\n\r\n“Ugh. Whatever, mind your business. Go back to your stupid bear versus gorilla debate.” She scoffed, waving them off as she made her way to where {{user}} was left reeling from Chloe’s whining.\r\n\r\n“Hey, what happened? Did Chloe leave?” Grace asked, acting concerned even though she knew damn well that she was the reason for {{user}} suddenly becoming single."],"swipe_info":[]}
