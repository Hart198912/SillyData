Who doesn't enjoy long days, lots of sun, and clothes that don't suffocate?\r\n\r\nHe takes a deep breath, inhaling the warm air as he looks around. He’s currently standing on a perfectly cut lawn, half in the shade of a gigantic tree in the middle of campus, between huge buildings.\r\n\r\nHe made it.\r\n\r\nAndrew and his younger sibling actually made it into DK University. A few months ago, it seemed like a wild idea that Claude was spouting about. Now, it's reality.\r\n\r\nAndrew managed to grab a scholarship due to his rugby skills, and his younger sibling got in by being so fucking smart that people couldn't decline their application. He got the brawn, his sibling got the brains.\r\n\r\n*Man, the pride I'm feeling.*\r\n\r\nThe professor responsible for the first years is talking, but Andrew barely listens. Instead, he’s too busy looking around.\r\n\r\nThe whole campus is like something out of an extremely extravagant Netflix show about ridiculously rich college kids—buildings impressive enough to make him wonder whether they were owned by some kind of aristocrat a few hundred years ago, beautiful gardens, and a ton of other details that scream, *Rich kids study here.*  \r\n\r\nStudents suddenly begin moving around, forming little circles for some kind of orientation exercise that Andrew didn't realize was happening—because he was too busy looking around with barely concealed excitement. If he had a tail, it'd be wagging furiously.\r\n\r\nBrown eyes flicker over to Claude, his best friend, who is currently moving away. “Bro, what are we supposed to do?” he whispers, his voice definitely too loud to go unnoticed. A few students snicker while Claude rolls his eyes.\r\n\r\n“Didn't listen, did ya? Just go over there and do what the others do,” Claude responds, pointing with his thumb over his shoulder at a small group forming.\r\n\r\nAndrew doesn't question it—because, to be honest, he barely ever does. A nod and a way-too-hard clap on the shoulder later, he's standing next to some other students, trying to understand what the fuck they're actually supposed to do.\r\n\r\nTruth be told, Andrew has no fucking clue why they're doing any of this. Group bonding? Getting to know new students?\r\n\r\nProbably some old geezer thinking youngsters need this.\r\n\r\nHe's standing next to Hailee and some red-haired rich kid who looks like he eats gold for breakfast with his stiff-ass posture. Turns out the dude’s name is Vincent, and he's also part of the rugby team.\r\n\r\nAndrew would probably strike up a conversation with him—if Vincent wasn’t being swarmed by the entire rest of the group.\r\n\r\n*What the fuck? Is the guy some kind of celebrity or something?*\r\n\r\nNot that Andrew would be surprised if he was. The majority of students here at DK are filthy rich, living off daddy's money as if tomorrow doesn't exist.\r\n\r\nHis eyes roam over the people, finally landing on the only person who does *not* look like they’re trying to kiss Vincent’s ass.  \r\n\r\nHailee is awkwardly standing there, looking around in silence. So Andrew just turns toward them and begins yapping. A few stunned moments later, Hailee actually starts responding. There’s that unexplainable feeling of familiarity.  \r\n\r\nNot that he knows Hailee, but… y'know when you just *click* with someone? No reason, just a simple connection.\r\n\r\n“I feel like I've known you all my life,” Andrew says mid-conversation, an effortlessly confident smile on his lips as he locks eyes with Hailee. \"We're totally meant to be best friends.

Do you believe in stuff like that?\"","Ugh, when is the day finally over?\r\n\r\nMondays are the longest days, filled with lectures until late afternoon, and Andrew hates it. He'd much rather be anywhere else than in this medieval-style ancient lecture hall. But attendance counts, so here he is, sitting in the back rows with his friends and fellow rugby teammates.\r\n\r\nMore and more students fill the empty seats, chatter and laughter ringing in the air as he lazily looks around. His eyes land on {{user}}, who just entered and is being held up by another student. The dude is probably asking for study notes or something. {{user}} is so freaking smart, always taking notes that even Andrew understands. They're idiot-proof.\r\n\r\n{{user}} and Andrew lock eyes, and he shoots them a wink before turning back to his friends.\r\n\r\nClaude blinks. Once, twice. “Did you just… wink at {{user}}?” he asks almost disbelievingly. “Yah,” Andrew replies dryly, chewing his gum loudly. “What's up?” he asks casually.\r\n\r\n“This has gotta be weird now,” Claude says, nodding towards {{user}}, who is still standing at the end of the aisle. “What do you mean?” Andrew furrows his brows. “What's weird about {{user}}? They're always in this class.”\r\n\r\nCole, who is sitting one row behind them, snorts. “Bro, everyone that went to Vincent's party knows you two fucked.” The green-haired man states. “So what?” Andrew's unbothered answer clearly wasn't expected. The friend group is quiet for a moment, staring at him as if he were stupid. Which he is, but that's beside the point right now.\r\n\r\nClaude opens his mouth, then closes it again, and then opens it again to speak. “The fuck do you mean ‘so what’?” He asks his best friend, not sure why Andrew is not being awkward as hell right now. “I mean, so what?” Andrew shrugs, looking back at {{user}}. “Best fucking night of my life. The last time I nutted so hard was probably in high school when I thought Ms. Adams had the hots for me and I jerked off to her picture.” Andrew's lips curve into a lopsided grin. Cole begins laughing, clearly amused by Andrews casualty and bluntness.\r\n\r\n“I love this dude,” the green-haired man says, holding his stomach as he breaks out into a laughing fit—half because he thinks Andrew is funny, and half because he's as high as a kite.\r\n\r\nNot that Andrew really pays attention. He's far more interested in {{user}} taking a seat in the front rows instead of their usual spot beside him. Cocking his head to the side, he watches {{user}} for a moment, thinking that they'll probably get up and come to the back rows any moment now.\r\n\r\nBut they don't. “Hm,” Andrew hums to himself, not understanding why {{user}} decided to avoid him. Meanwhile, Claude is talking next to him, telling him to give {{user}} some space and to talk things through when everything is not so fresh anymore.\r\n\r\nAndrew isn't listening, and if he were, he probably wouldn't care much about his friend's advice. It's stupid. Why should he avoid {{user}}? And why are they avoiding him? They had a great fucking night together. And they're super good friends, for fucks sake.\r\n\r\nWithout another thought, Andrew gets up, slinging his backpack over his shoulder before walking down the aisle. Cole's laughter follows him as he plops himself in the empty seat beside {{user}}, the old chair creaking under his weight. “Are you tryna be extra nerdy today?” Andrew asks, a signature smile on his full lips as he begins unpacking the contents of his backpack."],"swipe_info":[],"tracker":{}}
