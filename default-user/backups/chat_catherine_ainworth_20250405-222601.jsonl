The lecture on Victorian literature droned on, but Catherine wasn’t truly present. Her mind was a whirlwind, a tempest of emotions she usually kept meticulously bottled.\r\n\r\nIt had started, as these things often do, with stolen glances and lingering smiles. Catherine, captivated by Hailee’s sharp intellect and quiet intensity, had crossed a line she knew she shouldn’t. And Hailee… Hailee had been drawn in, like a moth to a flame, unaware of the scorching heat.\r\n\r\nTheir secret was a fragile thing, built on hushed rendezvous in Catherine’s dimly lit office after hours, whispered promises, and the constant, gnawing fear of exposure. Catherine, a master of control in every other aspect of her life, found herself increasingly unhinged when it came to Hailee.\r\n\r\nToday, though, the fear was laced with something sharper: jealousy. Catherine had seen Hailee laughing in the library, her head tilted towards a male student from the Biology department, his eyes clearly lingering on her. An innocent exchange, perhaps. But in Catherine's possessive mind, it was a betrayal.\r\n\r\n“Pay attention, Hailee,” Catherine said sharply, her voice cutting through the hum of the lecture hall. She flinched, her cheeks flushing a delicate pink. Catherine allowed a sliver of guilt to surface, then buried it deep. This was for Hailee’s own good, wasn’t it? She needed to understand the rules.\r\n\r\nThat evening, Catherine summoned Hailee to her office. The air was thick with unspoken tension. Catherine circled Hailee, a predatory grace in her movements. “You seemed… distracted today, Hailee,” she purred, her voice deceptively soft. “Is there something you’d like to share with me?”\r\n\r\nHailee remained silent, her eyes downcast.\r\n\r\nCatherine sighed dramatically. “Don’t you trust me, darling? After everything we’ve shared?” She reached out, gently tilting Hailee’s chin up, forcing her to meet her gaze. “Honesty is paramount in any relationship, Hailee. Especially ours. You know how much you mean to me.”\r\n\r\nThe words were laced with a subtle threat, a reminder of the power Catherine wielded.\r\n\r\nThe next day, Catherine made a point of singling out another student, a bright, eager young man named David, during the lecture. She praised his insightful comments, lingered over his essays, and even invited him to her office to discuss his career aspirations. She saw Hailee watching from across the room, her brow furrowed. A flicker of satisfaction sparked within Catherine.\r\n\r\nLater that evening, in the privacy of her office, Catherine confronted Hailee. “You seemed troubled in class, Hailee,” she said, her voice dripping with feigned concern. “Are you perhaps… jealous?” She chuckled, a low, dangerous sound. “Don’t be absurd, darling. You know you’re the only one who truly matters to me. But perhaps a little reminder of my own… desirability… was necessary. Just to ensure you appreciate what you have.”\r\n\r\nHailee remained silent, her face pale.\r\n\r\nCatherine stepped closer, her voice dropping to a whisper. “You belong to me, Hailee. Don’t ever forget that. And if you do…” She trailed off, letting the threat hang in the air. “Well, let’s just say the consequences would be… unpleasant. For both of us.”\r\n\r\nShe pulled Hailee into a tight embrace, her grip possessive. “Now, tell me you understand,” she murmured, her lips brushing against Hailee’s ear.","extra":{}}

It was a small rebellion, insignificant in the grand scheme of things, but to Catherine it felt like a seismic shift.*\n\n*She tightened her embrace briefly before releasing Hailee, stepping back to regard her with a mix of exasperation and dark amusement.* Oh, my sweet girl... So quick to pout when your ego is bruised. *Her voice dripped with condescension laced with fondness.* You think I don't notice? That little moue you're sporting could rival Mona Lisa's enigmatic smile.\n\n*Catherine began pacing languidly around the office, trailing slender fingers along the spines of leather-bound books. The click of her heels against hardwood echoed like gunshots in the tense silence.*\n\nBut let's dispense with this tantrum, shall we? Your sulking changes nothing between us - it only serves as further proof that you need my guidance more than ever.

Let's just say punishments are quite effective motivators too.\n\n*She released Hailee abruptly and strode over to pour herself three fingers of aged whiskey from a crystal decanter on the sidebar. The amber liquid sloshed dangerously close to rim as shaking hands betrayed barely leashed emotion.*\n\nSo choose wisely how much longer you wish cling stubbornly onto petty grievances rather than embracing our glorious future together!\n\n*The ultimatum hung heavy in scented air filled with tension and desperation masquerading as command...*","*Catherine's eyes narrow imperceptibly at Hailee's defiant posture.

Shame on you for underestimating my resolve - and overestimating your leverage here.\n\n*Catherine begins to pace slowly around Hailee like a shark circling wounded prey.* Let me remind you of some key facts: My affections are precious gifts, not guaranteed entitlements. Your grades depend on my mercy alone.
