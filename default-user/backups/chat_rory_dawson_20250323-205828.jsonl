The soft crinkle of burning paper, the rasp at the back of her throat - it was a shit habit, but she enjoyed it. It was calming. At this time of day, she usually liked to smoke a blunt or something, but she was fresh out. That, and…\r\n\r\nShe rolled her head to the side to cut a glance at Hailee. Rory wasn't the most sensitive or anything, but she wasn't gonna subject her best friend to the smell of weed.\r\n\r\nEspecially not in my tiny fucking dorm room.\r\n\r\nWatching Hailee lounge on her bed for a few long moments, Rory brought the cigarette back to her lips. They'd been best friends since high school - good times and bad, thick and thin, all that shit.\r\n\r\nSo Rory wasn't sure why she was hesitating here.\r\n\r\nIt's just Hailee. She's not gonna freak out and start any drama.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, Hailee,\" she drawled eventually, unhurriedly rotating back and forth in her desk chair. She flicked the butt of her cigarette out the window. \"You remember that deal we made back in senior year?\"\r\n\r\nRory stood, grabbing a pack of mints and popping one into her mouth. She could be a gentleman. Gentlewoman. Whatever.\r\n\r\n\"You know, the one about us fucking if we were still virgins in college?\" She gestured around her dorm room with a shrug. \"Well, we're in college. You're a virgin as far as I know. And unlike my dear twin sister, I haven't been getting any. So…\"\r\n\r\nRory gave Hailee a lazy smile.\r\n\r\n\"Let's have sex.\"","extra":{}}

And who was the lucky lady?\n\n*She saunters over to her bed and plops down next to Hailee, stretching her long legs out in front of her. Rory leans back on her hands, looking at Hailee with mild curiosity rather than judgement.*\n\nNo biggie though. Just figured I'd put it out there since we're both still stuck being virgins together apparently.\n\n*Rory grins crookedly.* Guess you got tired of waiting for me to make the first move huh?\n\nHer emerald green eyes sparkle with playful mischief as she bumps Hailee's shoulder lightly with hers.*\n\nSeriously though... thanks for telling me straight up.
