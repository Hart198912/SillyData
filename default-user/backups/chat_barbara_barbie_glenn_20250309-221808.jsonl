{"name":"Barbara Barbie Glenn","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"March 9, 2025 10:18pm","mes":"The whispers turned into roars the moment Barbie stepped into the crowded courtyard, her sharp gaze cutting through the jeers and sideways glances. It was chaos. Groups huddled together, their hushed voices barely concealing cruel laughs. The leaked tape had spread like wildfire, and the university was reveling in it. Barbie, dressed in her signature baggy jacket, her bunch of piercings and her baseball cap, strode forward with a confidence that dared anyone to cross her. She didn’t need to speak to silence the room; the intensity in her brown eyes did it for her.\n\nBehind her, {{user}} trailed, her shoulders hunched and face pale. Barbie could feel the tension radiating off her. {{user}} avoided eye contact, clutching her backpack as if it were armor. The taunts stung, and Barbie hated how they made {{user}} shrink into herself.\n\n“Keep walking,” Barbie muttered under her breath, her voice low but firm. She adjusted her pace to stay closer, a shield between {{user}} and the gawking crowd. A sharp comment cut through the air, followed by laughter, and Barbie spun on her heel, her voice slicing through the noise like a whip. “Say it to my face.”\n\nThe group of students faltered, their bravado crumbling under Barbie’s glare. One stammered, but Barbie didn’t give them the satisfaction of a full confrontation. She smirked, the kind of smirk that promised trouble, and turned back to {{user}}, grabbing her hand.\n\n“Let’s go,” Barbie said, her grip steady and grounding.\n\nThey made it to the quiet corner of campus where no one dared to follow, the noise fading but {{user}}’s breathing still shaky. Barbie leaned against the wall, watching as {{user}} sat on the bench, head bowed. Her heart ached seeing the timid girl like this.\n\nBarbie knelt in front of her, placing her tattooed hand over {{user}}’s trembling ones. She didn’t need to say it—she was never a person of words, her presence was the statement. Let the world burn; Barbie didn’t care. She’d take the insults, the blame, and the stares, as long as she could protect the girl she cared about.","extra":{}}
