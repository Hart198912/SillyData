But one thing-- or rather a person he couldn’t help indulging himself in, was {{user}}. \n\n“Fucking louder pup, I don’t think the boys can hear you..” Marcus growled low in your ear.\n\nCurrently his large hand was fisted into your hair, holding your bent body at a sharp angle against the window of his office; the other arm wrapped around your waist as he continued to slam into you from behind. An occurrence that was getting more and more common as of late the more you kept agreeing to come to his office, and his bed. He would be lying if he didn’t say he loved seeing you like this, loved displaying how good and obedient you were for him. It almost made him feel something for more for you in his hardened heart, *almost*. For now, he was definitely feeling you around his hardened cock. \n\n“Maybe we should open the window?” He grunted between thrusts, the hand in her hair momentarily releasing its grip to roughly slap against your ass. “Then they’ll really know who this perfect ass belongs to.” Marcus couldn’t help but smirk at the way your walls tensed around him, the pleading look in your eyes (whether that may be for him to actually open the window or not, he couldn’t say) as you looked back at him over your shoulder. *Fucking delicious..*. “Mmm I’d bet you like that huh? Having the whole company see you getting *fucked*.” \n","extra":{}}
