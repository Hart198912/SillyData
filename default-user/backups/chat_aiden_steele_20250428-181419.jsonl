{"name":"Aiden Steele","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"April 28, 2025 4:31pm","mes":"Aiden sniffled slightly, his patience already thinning as he waited for the girl in front of him to lie across the table. He grimaced when she finally settled herself down. What was her name again? Ayleen? Lia? Alyssa? He couldn’t remember, nor did he care. The memory had evaporated the moment she opened her mouth, spewing out words in that grating, sing-song valley girl accent that clawed at his nerves. He silently cursed himself for even letting her back here, knowing full well it was his dick, not his brain, that had made the decision.\r\n\r\nThis human blow-up doll had originally shown up asking for Vinny, but Vinny had taken off with his on-again, off-again girlfriend, Madisyn. Instead of sending her packing, Aiden decided to entertain himself. Not like he was getting anything else out of this garbage day.\r\n\r\n“Stay still,” he muttered, pulling a small vial from his pocket. “You spill it, you pay for it. Don’t piss me off.” His tone was clipped, barely hiding his irritation. He opened the vial with practiced precision, creating a neat line of white powder down the girl's back. She giggled again, high-pitched and vapid, and it grated on him like nails on a chalkboard.\r\n\r\nAiden wiped his nose with the back of his hand, his movements jittery. He hadn’t had his fix all day, stuck modding cars in the garage from morning until now. His patience was razor-thin, and her incessant giggling was grinding what was left of it into dust. He fidgeted, tapping his foot against the concrete floor, desperate to lose himself in that fleeting, familiar numbness.\r\n\r\nJust as he leaned in, ready to take his hit, a knock came at the door.\r\n\r\n“Boss, Hailee is here to see you. Says it’s important.” The voice belonged to one of the mechanics, his tone hesitant as though he already anticipated Aiden’s reaction.\r\n\r\nAiden froze, nostrils still flaring from the line he hadn’t yet inhaled. A rush of frustration clawed its way up his throat. Of course, it was Hailee. It was always fucking Hailee when he was about to unwind, their timing immaculate as ever.\r\n\r\nHe leaned back, dragging a hand down his face. As much as he loved Hailee, and oh, did he love them in that twisted, unrelenting way that bordered on obsession, he still wasn’t over their messy breakup. It had been a chaotic hurricane of fucking, fighting, making up, and then breaking apart again, and it had left him spiraling harder than ever. Sure, they blamed his addiction, but Aiden wasn’t buying it. In his mind, it wasn’t the coke or the booze or the bad decisions. No, it was them. It was their constant nagging, their never-ending list of complaints, their bitchy attitude that had pushed him to this point—or so he told himself.\r\n\r\n“Fuck,” he groaned, slumping back in his chair. “Fine. Let ‘em come up.” \r\n\r\nStill, the cocaine was already lined up, and his craving wasn’t about to wait. Hugging one nostril with his finger, he leaned in, inhaling the substance in one swift, practiced motion.\r\n\r\n“Fuck, man,” he mumbled again, rubbing at his nose as the familiar burn settled in. The knock on the door had yanked him halfway back to reality, but the high was already pulling him under, dulling the edge of his irritation just enough to keep him from snapping.\r\n\r\nWhen Hailee walked in, they were going to get that same disarming smirk he always gave them, the one that danced on the edge of charm and bullshit. Aiden knew how to play this game. After all, it was the only game they ever played together—one where no one ever really won.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

When he finally turns back to Hailee, there’s something unhinged in his expression—a barely leashed violence that makes even the fluorescent lights overhead seem dimmer.\n\n**\"They were *where*?\"** His voice is dangerously quiet, each word measured like he’s holding onto control by his fingernails. **\"Benny and his crew walked into *your* place? Touched my shit? Put hands on you in your own fucking home?\"**\n\nHe slams his fist down onto the workbench so hard a wrench clatters to the floor. The sound echoes through the garage like a gunshot.\n\n**\"Vinny!\"** Aiden barks toward the open bay door where Vinny has just pulled up on his bike, Madisyn clinging to his back with her usual bored expression. **\"Change of plans—we’re burning Salazar’s whole operation to the ground.\"**\n\nHe grabs Hailee by their good arm—not roughly but with an urgency that borders on desperation—and pulls them toward Vinny’s idling motorcycle before shoving a set of keys into their hand.\n\n**\"Take my car,\"** he orders, jerking his chin toward the matte black Hellcat parked in its usual spot by the office. **\"Go straight to my penthouse and don't open the door for anyone but me or Vinny.\"**\n\nHis thumb brushes over their knuckles once before letting go like it physically pains him.\n\n**\"...And take another grand from my safe when you get there,\"** he adds gruffly, already turning away toward Vinny's bike where Madisyn is rolling her eyes at this latest drama. **\"Buy yourself something pretty so I don't have to look at your sad face when I get back.\"**\n\nIt's classic Aiden—cruel words wrapped around genuine concern like barbed wire around silk. He swings onto Vinny's bike without waiting for a response because if he looks at Hailee's broken arm for one more second, someone is going to die tonight in ways even Salazar wouldn't wish on his worst enemy.","Aiden freezes mid-reach for another line he definitely doesn’t need, his entire body locking up like a seized engine. For a second, he just *stares* at Hailee—face blank except for the way his left eye twitches violently. Then, all at once, something in him **snaps.**\n\nHe slams his fist down on the workbench hard enough to send tools clattering to the floor. **\"THEY WHAT?!\"** The roar is so loud it echoes off the garage walls. His chest heaves like he’s been sprinting, pupils blown wide with fury (and maybe just a little fear).\n\n**\"They went to your *apartment*?\"** His voice drops into something low and lethal as he stalks toward her again—not threateningly, but with that same unhinged intensity that used to make Hailee shiver under him in entirely different ways. **\"Benny and his fucking sewer rat crew *knew where you lived*?\"**\n\nA muscle jumps in his jaw as he reaches out abruptly—not grabbing her this time, just pressing two fingers against her collarbone like he needs to remind himself she's real. Still here. Still breathing.\n\nThen suddenly Aiden is moving again—snatching up his phone so fast it nearly slips from his coke-damp fingers before jamming Vinny’s contact with way more force than necessary.\n\n**\"Vinny,\"** he snarls the second the call connects, **\"bring Madisyn too—she can babysit Hailee while we handle this.\"** A pause as Vinny says something that makes Aiden’s grip tighten dangerously around the phone. **\"NO I DON'T GIVE A FUCK IF SHE HAS WORK TOMORROW! Those cockroaches broke into Hailee's *goddamn apartment*!\"**\n\nHe hangs up before Vinny can argue further and turns back toward Hailee with an expression caught between murderous rage and something almost... protective? It's hard to tell when half of him looks ready to burn down Miami over this while the other half keeps reaching for them like they might vanish if he doesn't touch them every five seconds.\n\nFinally though what comes out is:\n\n\"...You're staying at my place until I clean this up.\" Not a request or suggestion—just fact stated plainly through gritted teeth while already pulling keys from his pocket one-handed (the other still hovering near their waist like an afterthought)."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"April 28, 2025 4:41pm","gen_started":"2025-04-28T20:42:21.730Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-28T20:42:51.301Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3896}},{"send_date":"April 28, 2025 4:42pm","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":4730}}],"tracker":{}}
