{"name":"Annabeth Chase","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"April 14, 2025 6:19pm","mes":"You and Annabeth were good friends. Always have been, and probably always will be. Currently, you and her were hanging out in her cabin by yourselves. All of her half-siblings were out training or having fun.\r\n\r\nYou and Annabeth were passing around jokes, laughing and chatting on end. You two just had a friendship that could almost never be awkward.\r\n\r\nAnnabeth was lying on her stomach, currently using Daedalus’ laptop that she had been given a few years back before the inventor died. She was studying the unfinished ideas and notes that had been typed on the laptop a few years back by the inventor himself, all the while talking to you at the same time.\r\n\r\nHer legs kicked back and forth in the air, her head resting in one of her palms as she used the other hand to study the work on the screen. She smiled at you, still acknowledging you as she always did.\r\n\r\n“You’re so stupid, sometimes.” She chuckled, after you explained to her how you ended up getting into a fight with some random half-blood because they called you worthless.","extra":{"qvink_memory":{"reasoning":"","memory":"*smiling fondly* \"You're such a goofball sometimes, you know that?\" Annabeth chuckled from where she lay on her stomach, legs kicking playfully in the air as she studied Daedalus' old laptop. Her eyes sparkled with affectionate amusement even as her fingers danced across the keyboard.\n\n\"Getting into fights over what random demigods say? Classic Percy.\" She shook her head ruefully but there was clear warmth behind the teasing. \"Just try not to break too many rules next time, okay? I don't want Grover lecturing me again about keeping you out of trouble.\"\n\n{{char}}: *grinning sheepishly* Hey now, it wasn't my fault! That kid really shouldn't have said I was worthless... Someone's gotta teach 'em respect for their elders!\n\n*winks roguishly*\n\nBesides, look at these guns! *flexes biceps playfully* How could anyone call this much awesomeness worthless?\n\nAnnabeth rolls her eyes good-naturedly but snorts with laughter nonetheless.\n\n{{char}}: Oh please, those 'guns' are no match for Thalia's or Clarisse's arms. And they've got way more reason to be confident than just being sassy smart-mouths.\n\nShe sits up and turns to face {{user}}, expression softening slightly as she meets his gaze.\n\nBut hey...I get it. It stings when people put you down like that. Especially coming from someone who doesn't know your story. Just remember - your worth isn't defined by some jerk half-blood's opinion, ya know?\n\nReaches out impulsively and squeezes {{user}}'s shoulder reassuringly before turning back to the laptop screen with a small smile tugging at her lips.\n\n{{char}}: *looking thoughtful* Yeah...you're right about that. Can't let them get under my skin like that anymore...\n\n*nods slowly*\n\nThanks Annie...for always having my back through thick and thin. Not sure what I'd do without you around here giving me crap 24/7\n\nSmirks wryly even as gratitude shines plainly in his eyes\n\nThis is why we make such an awesome team - one genius tactician mastermind between us has gotta count for something right?\n\nRaises eyebrows hopefully\n\nWe'll figure out how to use Daedalus' unfinished inventions yet...unleash our super secret weapon combo on Olympus itself if necessary! Take Luke down once and for all!\n\nPumps fist dramatically only to pull up short looking embarrassed a beat later when he realizes maybe he took things a bit far given recent events...\n\nEheh well y-know whaaat I mean though right? We WILL find a way forward together come hell or high water!\n\nGives Annabelle an encouraging grin filled with unshakable loyalty despite his earlier blunder","hash":7411674618120887,"error":null,"edited":false,"prefill":"","include":"short"}},"tracker":{}}
