{"name":"Claude","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"April 14, 2025 5:13pm","mes":"_It's too loud._\n\nAnother weekend, another party at Vincent's place. Claude and his group of friends usually have their party in the garage—more like a gigantic mini villa that Vincent just calls a garage for some reason. But the liquor is out, and after losing a round of rock-paper-scissors, Claude, David, and their stoned friend Cole are forced to go to the main house and get refills.\n\n\"Where the fuck is Cole even?\" Claude mutters under his breath, grabbing one of the expensive liquor bottles from the shelves.\n\nThe music, the chatter, and the uncomfortable scent of sweaty bodies mixed with spilled alcohol are disgusting. Claude scrunches his nose in disgust. He wasn't even planning on staying long today. All he wanted was to find someone attractive—someone that resembles {{user}}—to fuck in one of the endless guest rooms and then take her back home to {{user}}.\n\n“I don't even know why he came along, to be honest. We all know he won't carry shit.” David snorts while he grabs two bottles himself, the glass clinking as the bottles bump together. “Probably trying to find a fuck.” The long-haired man shrugs, then looks around.\n\nThe kitchen is surprisingly empty, which is a blessing. All the other rooms are fucking stuffed. “Talking about fucks,” David starts, his eyes landing on a poor soul that just passes by. “Looks like your type.” Shooting his friend with a shit-eating grin, he nods towards the student. Claude turns his head slightly and looks at the partygoer, just staring in silence for a moment. They look like {{user}}. Same hair color, same eye color, same stature. “Hm.” Claude hums in response, contemplating if he should approach them.\n\nHe's a hair's breadth away from shoving the bottles into David's arms when he suddenly hears it. Laughter. Not just any laughter. _{{user}}’s laughter._\n\nClaude's head snaps to the side and towards the source of the noise so fast that David is surprised he didn't hurt himself. {{user}} is here, at this fucking party, even though they're supposed to be home right now. Standing right next to the pool, a drink in their hand while they laugh at something, {{user}}’s back is turned towards Claude, but he fucking knows it's them. And the fucker in front of them? Cole.\n\nBefore he knows it, he's outside, stalking towards {{user}}. “Your guard dog is arriving in three… two…” Cole addresses {{user}}, clearly finding Claude's anger amusing. “One.” The green-haired man adds the moment Claude stops next to the pair. Shoving the bottles into Cole's arms, Claude raises his hand and slaps the back of Cole's head. “Shut the fuck up,” he hisses.\n\nCole's annoying fucking giggle rings in the air, the bottles clinking as he shifts to hold them properly. “Oh, c’mon, don't be such a party pooper,” Cole teases. Claude grabs {{user}}’s arm and begins pulling them away, blatantly ignoring his friend.\n\n“Are you out of your fucking mind?” he snaps once it's quieter, dragging {{user}} towards his car. All curses and protests are lost on him, his mind all over the place. “What if you would’ve gotten drugged? And some fucker would’ve tried to take advantage of you?” Claude is fucking furious. He hates this. He detests this.\n\nEach and every single time {{user}} thinks they can do whatever the fuck they want, he just fucking loses it. They're not supposed to do this. Can't they see that they're putting themselves in danger? Taking a deep breath, he tries to calm himself. Claude stops right in front of his car, fumbling with the key and unlocking it. “Get in. We're going home.” His tone brooks no argument.","extra":{}}
