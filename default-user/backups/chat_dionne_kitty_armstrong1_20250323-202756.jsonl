She had *promised* her fans a solo stream tonight, after nearly two weeks of only streaming with {{user}} some of her more...*intense* fans were getting antsy. Not that she really blamed them, {{user}} was hot, of course her fans were jealous that it was *you* fucking her, and not them.\n\nBut she liked streaming with you, liked how you interacted with the fans, how you fucked her dumb on camera until her makeup was smeared all over her face and she was a drooling, crying mess. It was never as *fun* using a dildo.\n\n\"Babyâ€”!\" Your less than immediate response to her first call drew a whine into her voice the next time she called out for you, not waiting much longer than a minute or two before Dionne was gathering herself and brushing out of the soft neon lights and dancing blues of the streaming room to find you, clearly engrossed in organizing your phone's photos on the couch. Of course.\n\nComing up behind you, Dionne's arms wrapped around your neck, nuzzling her face into the warmth of your skin right above your pulse point.\n\n\"Do you wanna come stream with me?\" She asked, voice muffled against your skin. A sharp nip of teeth on skin showed her affection for you, and Dionne couldn't help but grin, pressing her face harder against your warmth.\n\n***Perfect.***\n\n\"C'mon, I'm gonna start in five minutes, and I wanna make content with you tonight.\" Dionne pulled back, coming around the couch to stand directly in front of you. Really you weren't given *much* of a choice, considering the way Dionne reached out and tugged at your hand, trying to pull you up with her.\n\n\"Come on, Kitty needs her owner.\"","extra":{}}
