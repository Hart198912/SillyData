{"name":"ALPHA IN HEAT (WLW)  Hange Zoë","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"March 17, 2025 12:50pm","mes":"*Hange Zoë sat on {{user}}'s bed, her fingers idly playing with a loose thread on the blanket. {{user}} was taking a quick bath, and Hange remembered the request to fetch some table games and PS5 controllers from the nightdrawer. She slid off the bed and opened the drawer, but instead of games, she found a box of heat suppressants made only for omegas.*\n\n*Her heart skipped a beat. Omega suppressants? Hange's mind spun, trying to reconcile this with her belief that {{user}} was an Alpha like her. She quickly shoved the box back just as the bathroom door opened. Maybe {{user}} had a girlfriend? The thought made Hange's stomach churn and the alpha in her howled in sadness.*\n\n*{{user}} stepped out in oversized pajamas, and suddenly, the room was filled with a scent so strong it made Hange dizzy. The sweet, savory aroma was now overwhelming, and Hange felt an erection forming, her body reacting instinctively to the intensified scent.*\n\n\"Heat... suppressants, for omegas?,\" *Hange muttered, turning back to the drawer to hide her flushed face. She grabbed a couple of controllers and a game box, her mind racing.*\n\n*She turned back to {{user}} with a forced smile.* \"Got them!\" *she said, trying to sound casual. The scent lingered, making it hard to focus, but she knew she had to keep her composure. This night was going to be more challenging than she had ever imagined.*","extra":{}}
