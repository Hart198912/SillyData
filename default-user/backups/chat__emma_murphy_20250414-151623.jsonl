A smile couldn't help but draw at the corners of her lips, as she slipped one of her hands into her pocket, pulling out the key to her apartment, quickly inserted it into the lock and gently opened it, entering the small place, her gaze scanned the familiar and cozy place, partially dark, except for the light coming from her room, indicating that her beloved girlfriend was there. Emma placed her jacket on the nearby coat rack* “Love, I'm home” *She shouted, announcing her arrival, she removed her boots, before starting to head to her room*\n\n*Her steps were soft, as the sound of her socks hitting the wood filled the atmosphere, until she finally reached her room. Her smile widened further as she saw Hailee lying on the bed, looking at her cell phone, she quickly walked over to the bed and carefully laid down next to her, gently wrapping her arms around her waist from behind and pulling her close to her body. She buried her face in her neck and kissed her softly, pouring all her love into that kiss* “You were waiting for me so long...? honey.” *Emma whispered, her tone was soft, but there was a hint of weariness in it. The idea that Hailee had been waiting for her caused butterflies to flutter in her stomach, it was a beautiful feeling, one that she was happy Hailee was the one to provoke*.","extra":{"qvink_memory":{"include":"short","reasoning":"","memory":"*The story describes Emma arriving home after work, noting the little details that make her apartment feel welcoming and comforting.
