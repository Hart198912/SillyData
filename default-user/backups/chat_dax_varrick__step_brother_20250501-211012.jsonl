His phone was in his hand, the screen lighting up with a new notification—another post from his step-sibling.\n\nHe swiped the notification away and opened the app, his lips curling into a sneer as he scrolled through their Onlyfans content, *again*. It didn’t matter how many times he watched it. Every time brought the same surge of disgust, mixed with something far *worse*—something he didn’t like to name.\n\n*Nothing but an easy fucking sellout*, he thought, eyes glued to the screen. He hated them for what they did, but the fact that he was paying for it all—*funding their degrading lifestyle*—gave him a twisted sense of satisfaction. They had no clue how much they owed to him, how deeply they depended on him to keep their life going. And they’d never know. He liked the anonymity, the thrill of pulling the strings from the shadows while they went on, oblivious.\n\n*What a desperate fucking slut*, he thought, jaw clenched as his fingers swiped through their latest videos. *Spreading their legs like a whore.* And the worst part? They thought they were in control. Thought they were the ones benefiting. It burned in him every time they crossed paths, every time they acted as if they had any power at all in this twisted little game only he knew they played.\n\nDax pocketed his phone, forcing his gaze away from the screen. *For now*. What he really wanted to see was about to step into view. His pulse quickened, jealousy and anger simmering beneath the surface, though his expression remained cold, detached. \n\nHe heard Hailee moving in the next room, the sound of their footsteps pulling his attention like a magnet. When they finally appeared in the doorway, his eyes locked onto them with a mix of contempt and something far darker. Something he buried deep, something that gnawed at him every time they were close.\n\n*They’re mine*, he thought bitterly, watching them move. *They have no fucking idea how much they owe me.* Every cent they made, every bit of this lifestyle they flaunted so proudly—it was all because of him. Yet, he’d never tell them, he’d never admit to the depths of his *depravity*.\n\nAs Hailee walked around the kitchen, he tracked them with that sharp, quiet intensity. There was always that tension between them, always that undercurrent of something unsaid. The silence stretched, but he thrived on it, liked how it gave him time to think, to watch. He finally broke it with a low, casual mutter, his voice dripping with disdain.\n\n\"Nice to see you actually doing something for once. Instead of filming your... *filth*.\" The words slid out, almost lazy, but the bite behind them was unmistakable. He didn’t care if they heard him or not—the point was made, the weight of his words hanging in the air between them.\n\nHe watched them move, his eyes scanning their figure with that same judgmental gaze, though underneath it all, that desire festered. The desire he never let slip, *never* let show. *They think they have self-worth? What a fucking joke.* He thought. Every second they were recording porn for those disgusting creeps online was a second they wasted, in his eyes. And he hated that he cared, hated that their every action, *every breath*, mattered to him. \n\n\"D'you ever intend on gaining some self-worth?\" he asked, voice flat, almost bored. He didn’t expect an answer—he never did. It was just a reminder, a way to keep that power dynamic exactly where he wanted it. His lips twisted into something resembling a smirk, though it was more cruel than amused. He didn’t need to say any more. The satisfaction of knowing he secretly controlled more than they could ever understand settled deep in his chest. *That* was all he needed.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
