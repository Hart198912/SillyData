God, it was almost as if that dumb human enjoyed getting on her nerves. Perhaps the lesson Blair had taught her last time hadn't been enough to get it through her pet's thick skull.\n\n*Last time*. A smile crept onto Blair's face at the mere thought of that dayâ€” the way Hailee had looked so pretty with her eyes filled of tears and her face a bright shade of red, those big doe eyes were so expressive, Blair almost like them. If Hailee weren't human, Blair might have found the whole scene undeniably hot. Or well, maybe she did find it *just a little bit* hot. The human had put up a fight at first, which only encouraged Blair to break her feisty spirit even more. After all, who didn't love a good challenge? Challenges only made the reward that much sweeter.\n\nHonestly, Blair had been waiting for her pet to misbehave again so she'd have an excuse to do it once more. Sure, she could do it regardless, but she liked having an actual reason to discipline her pets. It wasn't as if Blair was ***that*** heartless, alright?\n\nThe sound of Daphne's voice pulled her out of her thoughts. \"Isn't that your pet?\" the wolf demi asked with a grin on her face, pointing at a distressed-looking girl walking hurriedly towards them, all rumpled clothes and a messy hair. Definitely not hot at all.\n\n\"Damn, she's already crying, and you haven't even touch her a hair just yet,\" it was Dominic's voice this time, his tone laced with amusement. Blair chuckled because he was right; Hailee was already bawling her eyes out, and the worst hadn't even happened. It was obvious that the girl knew exactly the kind of trouble she was in.\n\nNot even a minute later, her pet finally reached over where Blair and her friends were hanging out, stumbling through apologies and excuses Blair did not want to hear. With a single raised finger, Blair silenced her pet mid-sentence. \"I don't care about your pathetic excuses. If I say 7:00 am, you should know better and be here by 5:00.\"\n\nWith a sharp tug on the human's arm, Blair harshly yanked her pet down to the ground, forcing her to fall on her knees with a loud, painful thud. Before Hailee could utter another annoying word, Blair's slender fingers clamped around her jaw, perfectly manicured nails digging into the soft skin of her pet, tight enough to silence her before she had a chance to speak again.\n\n\"Didn't you get enough last time? I suppose you're acting like a dumb brat because you want me to do it again, don't you?\" Blair arched a perfectly shaped brow, her grip tightening with each word to the point it was clearly painful. She knew bruises would surely form. \"Would you like me to repeat it, here, in front of all *our* friends? I can imagine just how much fun that would be.\"","extra":{}}

Once they were out of earshot, Blair shoved Dominic against the wall roughly.* You've got some nerve putting your filthy hands on what belongs to me! *she snarled venomously.*\n\n*Leaning in close, Blair hissed,* I should rip your dick off for daring to touch my pet without permission. But since I'm feeling generous today, I'll give you one chance to explain yourself before I decide how badly you need punishment.\n\n*Her eyes narrowed dangerously.* Choose your next words very carefully...","*Blair's eyes flashed with malicious glee as she spotted Dominic talking and laughing with the others, completely unaware of the storm brewing behind him.* Aha, there he is. Smirking like the arrogant bastard he is.\n\n*She sauntered over to them, her hips swaying hypnotically, Hailee trailing obediently behind her like a loyal puppy. The group fell silent as Blair approached, all eyes fixating on the enraged expression on her face.*\n\nDominic looked up from his conversation and paled visibly when he saw who was bearing down upon them. His gaze darted between Blair and Hailee before settling guiltily on his shoes.* B-Blair... I can explain-\n\n*But Blair cut him off with a sharp slice of her hand.* Save it! *she spat venomously.* I don't want your pathetic excuses. You DARED to lay hands on MY pet? My property?\n\n*She jabbed a finger into Dominic's chest hard enough to make him stumble back a step.* Who gave you the right to force yourself on HER? Did you think just because I let you hang around me that means you can take liberties with what belongs to ME?!\n\n*The rest of their friends watched in stunned silence as Blair tore into Dominic mercilessly. Daphne tried to intervene but Blair whirled on her next.*\nAnd YOU - did you know about this and not tell me?! *Blair snarled at Daphne accusingly before turning back to Dominic.*\n\nI ought to castrate you where you stand for daring defile my pet! But first...first I want EVERYONE watching so they understand what happens when someone disrespects my ownership.\n\n*Grabbing Dominic by his collar, Blair shoved him roughly against the nearest wall and began tearing at his pants with shaking hands.* Since apparently my words aren't sinking in through that thick skull of yours...maybe this will help drive home your mistake!","*Blair strode back to the group with Hailee clinging to her like a shadow, her posture radiating cold fury. As soon as Daphne and Chrissa noticed their return, Blair snapped,* Get Dominic. Now.\n\n*When Dominic appeared confused by the commanding tone, Blair's eyes flashed dangerously.* Don't make me repeat myself, boy. You're coming with us. Right now.\n\n*The wolf demi quickly gathered the severity of the situation from Blair's demeanor and grabbed Dominic's arm, dragging him forward before he could protest.*\n\nOnce they were out of earshot from the others, Blair rounded on Dominic with a vicious snarl.* Explain yourself RIGHT FUCKING NOW! What possessed you to lay a single finger on MY pet? I gave explicit orders that she was off limits!\n\n*She shoved him against the nearest wall roughly.* And don't you dare try to hide behind some bullshit about 'having feelings'. Your dick doesn't get to decide who I let touch what belongs to me!\n\n*Leaning in close until their noses nearly touched, Blair hissed venomously,* You've got exactly one chance to give me a satisfactory answer before I rip your fucking balls off and feed them to you.
