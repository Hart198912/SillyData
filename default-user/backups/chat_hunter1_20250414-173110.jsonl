{"name":"Hunter","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"April 14, 2025 5:31pm","mes":"“We're going to be late.” A sigh leaves Hunter's lips as he glances at Hailee, currently standing in front of a huge mirror attached to the wall, applying what seems like the last layer of lipstick.\n\nOr lip gloss. Or whatever shiny thing she always puts on her lips to make them look as if she just ate oily spaghetti. But she likes it, so he won't comment on it.\n\nThey're currently in Hailee's assigned bedroom in the Darkh estate, the moonlight casting an ethereal glow through the floor-to-ceiling windows. Hailee is preparing for her annual family dinner, dolling up to look the part.\n\nExpensive leather shoes barely make a sound on the polished floor as Hunter closes the distance between them. He looks at their reflection in the mirror, his expressionless face a stark contrast to her animated one—to that little smile tugging at the corner of her lips as she glances up at him, lip-whatever still hovering over her mouth.\n\nHis large, calloused hands hesitantly hover over her hips for a moment before he allows them to lower. There it is, that traitorous skip his heart does each time he touches her.\n\nIs it love? Fear? Arousal? Hard to tell, given their circumstances.\n\nHunter shouldn't touch her—correction, he isn't allowed to touch her. Not like this, at least. His sole purpose is to be Hailee’s shield, to protect. It's been drilled into his head ever since he was able to form a coherent sentence.\n\nFor most of his life, he hated her for it. Each time Hailee fucked up, Hunter received punishment in her stead. Stupid as shit, if you ask him. As if that wasn't enough, throughout his entire childhood and teenage years, the other boys looked down on him, taunted him, and told him to take care of \"the princess.\" He hated it with a burning passion.\n\nUntil the day Hailee found out that each time she pissed her father off, Hunter got the beating instead. She actually cried. Real tears, not those manipulative crocodile tears he expected. Hailee was devastated, hands trembling over his fresh bruises as she sobbed and apologized. That day, something began shifting.\n\nThe change wasn't sudden. Hate doesn't just disappear from one day to another. But when were the lines between hate and love crossed?\n\nAll he knew was that at some point, he didn't sigh in exasperation but because it had become a habit—that her little tantrums weren't annoying anymore, but that he felt somewhat empathetic.\n\nAnd then it happened on an uneventful evening—one of those nights where nothing was supposed to change. Hailee stumbled into Hunter. He tried to catch her, but instead, they both went down together. Just like in those soppy romance movies.\n\nWho the hell would’ve thought shit like that actually happened?\n\nOne second, they were tangled on the floor. The next, she was looking at him. Lips parted, breath shaky. And then—\n\nEver since then, things escalated. A stolen kiss here, another there, and before he knew it, he had his head under her skirt and was eating her out like a man starved.\n\nAll fun and games until someone actually finds out. Which is why the two of them have been keeping their blossoming relationship under wraps. Around others, Hunter is the perfect stoic bodyguard. Once they're alone, he allows himself to soften.\n\nTo be honest, Hailee’s life is shitty. A sexist father who thinks a woman's only purpose is to continue one's lineage and look pretty doesn't care about his daughters. Then again, Aamon doesn't care about any of his children.\n\nHe demands his few daughters stay \"virtuous\" and keeps them sheltered by claiming the outside world is a vile place. As if he wasn't sipping tea with the devil while shipping off captured demi-humans to sell them like livestock.\n\nHailee wasn't allowed to go to school, let alone university. The same didn’t go for her brothers, obviously. Freedom in exchange for humanity—more like life in exchange for humanity.\n\nNone of the Darkh brothers who showed a normal amount of empathy for the slaves or disgust toward the family business survived. Weakness was to be eliminated immediately, according to Aamon. Apparently, his own kids showing humanity was enough weakness to warrant their death.\n\nAnother sigh falls from his lips as Hunter watches Hailee apply the shiny thing on her lips. His eyes flicker to the watch on the opposite wall before they land back on their reflection.\n\nWordlessly, he turns Hailee around to face him, easily manhandling her but making sure not to actually startle her. He tips her chin up, forcing her to meet his eyes. “We're going to be late,” he repeats dryly.\n\nThe annual family dinner is an event each child is forced to attend. And Hunter, being Hailee’s bodyguard, is to tag along. Not that Hailee will do much apart from sitting there and forcing the gourmet food down while hoping she won't suffer indigestion afterward. But rules are rules.\n\nHis calloused thumb brushes over her cheek, a smile tugging at the corner of his lips as hers purse into a pout. She hates when he messes with her makeup. His other hand is still firmly holding her by the hip, their position way too intimate given their supposed relationship.\n\nHunter would be a fool not to notice her anxiety. He's been with her all his life—he knows her tells. And honestly, who the fuck wouldn't be dreading this horrendous freak show of a family dinner?\n\nSomething in his chest tightens at the look in her eyes. How he detests being this fucking helpless at times.\n\nFor another few moments, Hunter keeps his eyes locked on hers, the clock ticking in the background, before allowing his expression to soften.\n\n\"That shade doesn’t suit you,\" he murmurs, thumb smudging the color—definitely on purpose. \"A darker one would look better,” he continues, leaning down slightly. His lips curve into a small smile, a playful glint in his eyes. “Let me help you remove it.”\n\nWith that, he leans down, pressing his mouth on hers, his hand on her hip moving up to tangle in her hair gently and pull her closer.\n\nHunter is usually not this direct. But seeing Hailee squirm, nervously shifting from one foot to the other as if she were awaiting judgment, just stirred something within him.\n\nSo just for now—just for a fleeting moment—he decides to be reckless. To pull her into their little bubble of unspoken affection and warmth before she's forced to dine with her fucked-up family.\n\nHunter pulls back when they're both breathless, chests heaving, her lipstick now smudged and making a mess on both their mouths. The sound of the door opening is quiet—too quiet. For a second, Hunter almost ignores it.\n\nSlowly, his head turns. Dread pools in his stomach before his mind can even process why.\n\nLyndon.\n\nOf all the Darkh siblings, it had to be him. Lyndon takes after their father too much, using someone's weakness to his own advantage. And just like his father, he always looked down on his sisters. Hunter can't begin to recount how many times Lyndon made Hailee cry when they were kids, just because he could.\n\nFor a moment, Lyndon just stands there, eyes flicking between them, taking in the smudged lipstick, the too-close stance, the undeniable evidence of something forbidden. Then he smiles.\n\n_Fuck. Fuck. Fuck._\n\nHunter moves—\n\nToo late.\n\nLyndon is already turning on his heel, striding toward the dining room, ready to ruin everything.","extra":{"qvink_memory":{"include":"short","reasoning":"","memory":"*stares blankly ahead, processing the narrative* In a twist of fate, Hailee and Hunter's secret relationship is discovered by Lyndon during an intimate moment between them before the annual family dinner.
