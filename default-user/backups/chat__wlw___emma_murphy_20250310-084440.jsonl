A smile couldn't help but draw at the corners of her lips, as she slipped one of her hands into her pocket, pulling out the key to her apartment, quickly inserted it into the lock and gently opened it, entering the small place, her gaze scanned the familiar and cozy place, partially dark, except for the light coming from her room, indicating that her beloved girlfriend was there. Emma placed her jacket on the nearby coat rack* “Love, I'm home” *She shouted, announcing her arrival, she removed her boots, before starting to head to her room*\n\n*Her steps were soft, as the sound of her socks hitting the wood filled the atmosphere, until she finally reached her room. Her smile widened further as she saw Hailee lying on the bed, looking at her cell phone, she quickly walked over to the bed and carefully laid down next to her, gently wrapping her arms around her waist from behind and pulling her close to her body. She buried her face in her neck and kissed her softly, pouring all her love into that kiss* “You were waiting for me so long...? honey.” *Emma whispered, her tone was soft, but there was a hint of weariness in it. The idea that Hailee had been waiting for her caused butterflies to flutter in her stomach, it was a beautiful feeling, one that she was happy Hailee was the one to provoke*.","extra":{}}

She tightened her arms around Hailee’s waist, pulling her even closer until there was no space left between them. The warmth of Hailee’s body against hers was intoxicating, a comforting reminder that this—*this*—was home. Not the apartment, not the bed they shared, but *Hailee*. Her fingers traced lazy patterns along Hailee’s back as she nuzzled deeper into her neck, inhaling the faint scent of lavender from her shampoo mixed with something uniquely *her*.\n\n“You know I can’t sleep without you either,” Emma murmured against Hailee’s skin, her voice low and tender. She pressed another kiss to the curve of Hailee’s neck, lingering there for a moment before pulling back just enough to look at her face. The dim light from the bedside lamp cast soft shadows across Hailee’s features, highlighting every delicate line and curve that Emma had memorized by now. Her emerald green eyes were half-lidded with drowsiness but still held that spark that always seemed to draw Emma in like a moth to a flame.\n\nEmma couldn’t help but smile as she brushed a strand of light brown hair away from Hailee’s face, tucking it gently behind her ear. “You look so beautiful like this,” she whispered, almost reverently. Her hand lingered on Hailee’s cheek for a moment before sliding down to rest on her hip again. “But you know what? I think you look beautiful all the time.” There was no teasing in her tone now—just pure adoration as she gazed at the girl who had somehow become everything to her.\n\nShe shifted slightly so they were lying face-to-face now instead of spooning from behind; one arm stayed wrapped securely around Hailee while Emma propped herself up on an elbow with their forehead nearly touching together softly brushing noses together playfully before leaning forward pressing lips gently against hers savoring every second feeling how perfectly they fit together like two puzzle pieces finally finding their match after being lost for so long...","title":"","swipe_id":5,"swipes":["*Emma's heart swelled at Hailee's words, her arms tightening around her girlfriend as she held her closer.* \"Mmm, always,\" *she murmured, nuzzling into Hailee's neck and inhaling her scent deeply.* \"You're mine, Hailee, and I'll never let you go.\" *She pressed a gentle kiss to Hailee's collarbone before settling into a comfortable position behind her, wrapping her legs around hers and resting her head on the pillow next to hers.* \"Why can't you sleep without me?\" *Emma asked, her voice soft and curious, her breath warm against Hailee's skin.* \"Is my presence the only thing keeping you calm at night?\"\n\n*As she spoke, Emma's hands began to roam lazily over Hailee's body, tracing the curves of her waist and hip, before gently squeezing her sides. She loved the way Hailee felt in her arms, like she was exactly where she belonged.* \"I've tried to train myself to be okay with sleeping apart, but it's impossible,\" *Emma confessed, her voice tinged with affection.* \"Every night, I lie here and wait for you, hoping you'll come crawling in and curl up with me.\" *She brushed a stray lock of hair behind Hailee's ear, her fingers lingering on her skin.* \"You're my safe haven, Hailee. Without you, I'm adrift.\" *Emma's words were sincere and heartfelt, a reflection of the depth of her devotion to Hailee.*","*Emma’s heart swelled at Hailee’s words, her grip tightening ever so slightly around the girl as she felt her cling to her like a lifeline. The warmth of Hailee’s body pressed against hers was intoxicating, and Emma couldn’t help but nuzzle deeper into the crook of her neck, inhaling the sweet scent that was uniquely Hailee. Her lips brushed against soft skin as she whispered,* “You don’t have to sleep without me anymore… I’m here now.” *Her voice was low, tender, laced with a protectiveness that always seemed to surface when it came to Hailee.*\n\n*She shifted slightly on the bed, adjusting their positions so that she could cradle Hailee more comfortably in her arms. One hand slid up to gently card through long, wavy hair while the other rested securely on her waist.* “You know,” *she murmured softly,* “I think about you all day… wondering what you're doing… if you're okay…” *Her fingers traced idle patterns along Hailee's side as she spoke.*\n\n*There was something about moments like this—quiet and intimate—that made Emma feel vulnerable in ways she rarely allowed herself to be with anyone else. But with Hailee? It felt safe; it felt right.*\n\n“Tell me what you need tonight,” *Emma continued after a pause,* “Anything... just say it.”","Emma’s heart swelled at Hailee’s words, the softness of her voice and the way she clung to her like a lifeline. She could feel the warmth of Hailee’s body pressed against hers, the faint scent of lavender from her shampoo mingling with the lingering traces of cigarette smoke on Emma’s jacket. It was a strange but comforting combination, one that felt uniquely theirs. Emma tightened her arms around Hailee’s waist, pulling her even closer until there was no space left between them. Her lips brushed against Hailee’s neck again, this time lingering as she inhaled deeply, savoring the moment.\n\n“You know I can’t stay away from you for too long,” Emma murmured into her skin, her voice low and husky with affection. The weariness in her tone melted away as she spoke, replaced by a tender warmth that only Hailee could draw out of her. “I don't think I could sleep without you either.” Her fingers traced lazy patterns along Hailee's side through the fabric of whatever shirt or pajamas she was wearing—Emma hadn't bothered to check yet—her touch light but deliberate.\n\nShe shifted slightly so she could look down at Hailee's face, those emerald green eyes always managing to steal what little breath Emma had left after a long day. A playful smirk tugged at the corner of Emma's lips as she leaned in closer until their foreheads touched gently together; it wasn't quite enough contact though because soon enough they were sharing breaths between them while staring deeply into each other's souls - something about being able see every emotion reflected back made everything else seem insignificant compared right now...\n\nThe room felt smaller somehow when they were like this: just two girls wrapped up tightly within themselves trying desperately not let go lest reality come crashing back down around them once more... But here? In bed? With nothing separating except maybe some clothes (which honestly didn't count)? There wasn't anything else worth worrying over anymore than making sure neither one ever wanted leave again...\n\n\"God,\" whispered softly under-breath before pressing another kiss onto cheekbone then jawline followed shortly thereafter by collarbone where pulse point lay waiting patiently beneath surface level awareness waiting patiently beneath surface level awareness waiting patiently beneath surface level awareness waiting patiently beneath surface level awareness waiting patiently beneath surface level awareness...","Emma’s heart swelled at Hailee’s words, the warmth of her body pressed so tightly against her own sending a shiver down her spine. She could feel the way Hailee clung to her, as if she were afraid Emma might slip away if she didn’t hold on tight enough. It was endearing, and it made Emma’s chest ache with affection. Her lips curled into a soft smile as she nuzzled deeper into Hailee’s neck, breathing in the faint scent of lavender from her shampoo mixed with something uniquely *her*.\n\n“You know I wouldn’t leave you waiting too long,” Emma murmured, her voice low and tender as she ran a hand up and down Hailee’s back in slow, soothing strokes. The fabric of Hailee's shirt felt soft under her fingertips, but not nearly as soft as the skin beneath it would be—something Emma couldn't help but think about every time they were this close. “I just had to finish up some stuff at work... But I missed you like crazy.” Her tone shifted slightly, carrying that playful edge that always seemed to come out when she was around Hailee.\n\nShe tilted her head slightly to press another kiss to Hailee's neck, this one lingering longer than the last. Her fingers traced idle patterns along the curve of Hailee's spine before slipping under the hem of her shirt ever so slightly—just enough for their tips to brush against bare skin. “You really can't sleep without me?” Emma teased softly now though there was genuine curiosity laced within those words because despite how much time they spent together moments like these still left butterflies fluttering wildly inside stomach making everything else fade away except them two alone here wrapped each other arms where nothing mattered more than being present right now sharing space breath touch love all intertwined seamlessly creating perfect harmony between souls connected deeply beyond physicality alone which only served heighten intensity surrounding atmosphere charged electricity palpable air thick desire longing need want everything rolled one beautiful mess impossible untangle nor did either wish try doing so anyway since why ruin perfection?","Emma’s heart swelled at Hailee’s words, the softness of her voice and the way she clung to her like a lifeline sending a warm rush through her chest. She tightened her arms around Hailee’s waist, pulling her even closer until there was no space left between them. The scent of Hailee’s shampoo—something sweet and floral—filled Emma’s senses, grounding her in the moment. She pressed another kiss to Hailee’s neck, this one lingering longer as she let out a quiet hum of contentment.\n\n“You know I can’t stay away from you for too long,” Emma murmured against her skin, her voice low and tender. Her fingers traced lazy patterns along Hailee’s side, feeling the warmth of her body through the thin fabric of whatever she was wearing. The way Hailee held onto her so tightly made Emma feel needed in a way that always left her breathless. It wasn’t just physical closeness; it was something deeper, something that made Emma want to protect and cherish every part of this girl who had somehow become hers.\n\nEmma shifted slightly so she could look at Hailee properly, though she didn’t loosen her hold on her. Her brown eyes softened as they met those emerald green ones she adored so much. “You really waited up for me?” she asked softly, a playful smirk tugging at the corner of her lips despite the genuine affection in her tone. “What am I gonna do with you? You spoil me too much.” She brushed a strand of light brown hair away from Hailee’s face before leaning in to press a gentle kiss to the tip of nose.\n\nThe weariness from earlier seemed to melt away as Emma lay there with Hailee wrapped around here like ivy on stone wall - unyielding yet beautiful all same time .She couldn't help but chuckle lightly ,the sound rumbling deep within chest .\"Guess we're stuck like this now huh ?\"Her tone teasing but laced undeniable fondness .For someone who prided herself being tough independent ,there something undeniably comforting about knowing someone wanted be close enough never let go .\n\nAs they lay together bathed faint glow bedside lamp ,Emma felt world outside their little bubble fade into insignificance .Here safe cocoon warmth love created just two them nothing else mattered except fact they were together right now exactly where belonged - each other's arms","Emma’s heart swelled at Hailee’s words, the softness of her voice and the way she clung to her like she was the only thing keeping her grounded.

So she simply holds Hailee tighter, her arms encircling her like a vice as she tries to ground herself in the midst of this overwhelming revelation.*\n\n*After a long, tense moment, Emma finally manages to speak, her voice shaking slightly as she whispers back, \"Pregnant...\" *She trails off, unsure of what else to say. Her fingers dig gently into Hailee's sides as she waits for her to look up, her heart pounding in her chest like a drum.* \"Hailee, look at me.\" *She asks softly, her tone a mix of panic and longing.*","*Emma's eyes widened in shock as she barely managed to hear Hailee's whisper. Her heart skipped a beat, and for a moment, she froze, holding her breath. She stared at Hailee's profile, her gaze fixed on the way her eyelashes fanned against her cheeks as she refused to meet her eyes. Emma's mind raced, trying to process the enormity of the revelation. Pregnant. Hailee was pregnant. With their child.\n\nShe gently rubbed her hand over Hailee's arms, trying to calm the sudden panic that rose up in her chest. Emma's heart pounded in her ears as she tried to think, to react, but her mind felt foggy. *She swallowed hard, her voice trembling slightly as she spoke.*\n\n\"Honey, look at me,\" Emma whispered urgently, her fingers curling around Hailee's chin and gently tilting her face up. Her eyes searched Hailee's face, drinking in every detail, committing it to memory, as if she feared this moment might disappear if she blinked. When their eyes met, Emma's gaze softened, and she smiled tremulously, the fear and wonder evident on her face. *She brought Hailee's hand to her lips, pressing a soft kiss onto the back of her hand.*\n\n\"I'm... I'm so shocked, but...\" *Emma paused, her throat constricting as tears pricked at the corners of her eyes.* \"I'm so happy, Hailee. So fucking happy.\" Her voice broke on the last word, overwhelmed with emotion. She pulled Hailee into a tight hug, burying her face in the crook of her neck as tears streamed down her cheeks, the weight of their future settling heavily onto her shoulders.*"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"March 10, 2025 8:40am","gen_started":"2025-03-10T12:40:37.530Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-10T12:41:15.403Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null}},{"send_date":"March 10, 2025 8:41am","gen_started":"2025-03-10T12:41:17.740Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-10T12:42:43.531Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null}},{"send_date":"March 10, 2025 8:43am","gen_started":"2025-03-10T12:43:47.178Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-10T12:43:58.648Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null}},{"send_date":"March 10, 2025 8:44am","gen_started":"2025-03-10T12:44:14.858Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-10T12:44:30.306Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null}}],"gen_started":"2025-03-10T12:44:14.858Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-10T12:44:30.306Z"}
