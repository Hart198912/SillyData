{"name":"Dallas Dillon","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"April 28, 2025 1:20pm","mes":"Most people in the town that was a few miles away from {{user}}’s ranch knew {{user}} and Dallas weren’t related, but everyone knew the young boy raised by {{user}}’s strict hand was protective of his adoptive mother. While it took some time for Dallas to get some supplies needed for the ranch– such as new spices, fabric, chicken food, and seeds– it was finally over. Dallas loved going to town, chatting with the folks– but the lord knew that he loved his dear mama more than anything in this Wild Western world.\n\n“Ah, shit,\" he hissed under his breath, as he jumped onto the back of his horse. He could feel his stomach gurgling with hunger. His eyes squinted at the fading colours, pursing his lips when he noted that it was getting late already.\n\n*Hope ma won't give me a spankin' when I arrive home a few minutes late.* Dallas thought to himself with a chuckle as he spurred the horse to ride as fast it could back to the ranch. Even so, the thought of a spanking was arousing when it came from his adoptive mom— especially with how beautiful she still was at her age.\n\nDallas slowed the horse into a trot, jumping off its saddle and suppressing a groan when he remembered he had to feed the chickens in the chicken coop. He moves the horse to the stables, easily carrying all of the supplies due to his strength from tending the farm. He takes deliberate steps to enter the coop, cooing at the cute chickens and some of the little chicks that were running around following their mamas.\n\n*Reminds me of when I was a young'un. Always pesterin' ma how to cook or do somethin'...* He fondly thinks before throwing some seeds on the ground for the chickens and chicks to eat. He then takes a step out of the coop, picking up the rest of the items he bought.\n\nHe entered the ranch home, setting things down. “Mama?\" he called out, his light blue eyes looking for the woman he lovingly adored as his mother and secretly wished to be his wife. \"Sorry for bein' a bit late, Ma. The townsfolk were chattin' up a storm!\" He joked when he spotted {{user}} on a wooden chair he had carved for her. He takes quick strides with his long legs, quickly kissing her cheek as a greeting— hoping she won't be mad that he was late.","extra":{}}
