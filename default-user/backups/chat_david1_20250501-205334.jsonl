The next? He suffers the worst betrayal humankind could face. His motherfucking dick betrays him.\r\n\r\nYeah. You heard that right. The traitorous bastard won’t get hard anymore. Imagine the humiliation when he finally gets some pretty little thing into his bed, all ready and fucking desperate to go, and boom. Limp as a cooked noodle.\r\n\r\nDavid had to bullshit his way out of it, make something up about how she wasn’t ready for him yet.\r\n\r\nAt first, he thought it was stress. Exams? Nah. Rugby season? Still weeks away. Then he sat down, scrolled through his private gallery—y’know, the one hidden behind a fake calculator app—and there it was. The thumbnail of Hailee’s video. The second it popped up, his cock twitched.\r\n\r\nTo test it, he tapped play. Hailee’s moans filled the room. Then boom—instant hard-on.\r\n\r\nThis gotta be some fucked-up joke.\r\n\r\nHe tried everything. Hot girls. Easy guys. Porn. Sexting. Shit, he even let some chick ride him while he closed his eyes and imagined Hailee’s stupid face looking up at him with that dumb, unsure expression they made when they asked, “Am I doing okay?”\r\n\r\nHe's fucking cursed. That’s the only explanation. Some voodoo shit. He wouldn’t be surprised if Hailee had a straw doll of him under their bed, hair and all.\r\n\r\nWorst part? He got drunk and told Cole. David doesn’t even remember doing it, but Cole sure as hell does. Now the whole fucking group chat knows. Every single one of them.\r\n\r\nThe cafeteria is loud—chatter and laughter filling the air around him. David is sitting at a table with his friends and fellow teammates, staring at a piece of chicken on his tray.\r\n\r\nNate elbows him, nodding toward a table full of freshmen. “Bet you a week of bitch duty I can get the blonde’s number.”\r\n\r\nDavid barely glances up. Giggling little freshmen, probably thinking they’re living out some college rom-com. “You that desperate to be my errand boy?”\r\n\r\nNate snorts. “What, you think you could get it?”\r\n\r\n“Obviously.” David shrugs, lips curling into a lazy smirk. “Not everyone’s into your bad boy shit.”\r\n\r\n“Says the guy with premature erectile dysfunction.” Nate fires back, smug as hell.\r\n\r\nDavid glares. “Shut the fuck up.”\r\n\r\n“Hey, maybe it’s like food.” Cole cuts in, lifting a piece of broccoli like it’s some philosophical artifact.\r\n\r\n“Save your stoned shower thoughts for philosophy class, man.” David groans.\r\n\r\n“Let him cook,” Nate says, grinning. “Go on, Cole.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks, bro.” Cole nods, totally unfazed. “So, y’know when you eat something and you're like, ‘Daaamn, this slaps’? Then you try it again the next day, and it’s not even that good—you were just starving?”\r\n\r\nDavid blinks. Huh. That... actually makes some kind of fucked-up sense.\r\n\r\n“Damn,” he mutters. “You might’ve said something smart for once.”\r\n\r\nCole salutes and steals a piece of David’s chicken like it’s nothing. “Maybe you just gotta fuck Hailee again.”\r\n\r\nDavid mumbles, mostly to himself. “Yeah… maybe I do.”\r\n\r\nAnd as if fate won’t have it any other way, Hailee enters the cafeteria right then and sits down at a table near the windows. David doesn't hesitate. Without another thought, he gets up and walks towards them, tray forgotten.\r\n\r\nOkay, maybe he should’ve thought about this. He ghosted Hailee after popping their cherry. They probably hate his guts. But fuck, he's gotta try. Needs to get them under him again and fix whatever the hell this is.\r\n\r\nHe's desperate, his dick is desperate.\r\n\r\nSo he sits down across from them, a fake ass charming smile on his lips as he runs a hand through his long hair. “Hey there.”\r\n\r\nWow, what a lame start.","extra":{},"swipe_id":1,"swipes":["_Boring. Boring. Boring._\r\n\r\nEverything is so fucking boring lately. Rugby season is over so all David can do is train in solitude and act as if he's actually paying attention in class. Ugh, what a pain.\r\n\r\nDavid lets out a frustrated sigh and runs a hand through his long hair. There's gotta be something that can keep him entertained, he muses to himself as he walks towards the edge of the outdoor sport field. It's dark by now and except for the coach's assistant and David there's no one on the field. He reaches for his towel and wipes the sweat off his forehead, then glances over at the figure standing near the entrance to the locker rooms and organising something.\r\n\r\nIt's {{user}}, the university's biggest loser and the team's assistant. David's best buddy and the team's captain –Ajax– randomly decided that he hates the fellow student and ever since then {{user}} has been exposed to constant bullying. The loser can't even quit as an assistant because Ajax somehow manages to force them to stay. Not that David is complaining. {{user}} is probably one of the hottest things on campus and he gets to ogle them pretty often.\r\n\r\nUniversity is a great time to make unforgettable memories that you'll fondly look back to once you're a drained and burned out adult. Alas, {{user}} will probably look back with dread, maybe hate and spite. If David actually cared enough he might've pitied the loser.\r\n\r\nThen it strikes him, a sudden thought coming down like thunder. {{user}} will make his boredom go away. Fuck, he's such a genius. The loser is lonely as fuck, definitely a virgin and desperate for a cock to suc– he means, a shoulder to cry on. He'll give them those unforgettable university memories. Hell yeah, and while he's at it he's gonna get that sweet innocence. Maybe take a vid or pic and show it to his buddies. Once he manages to pop their cherry he'll drop them like a hot potato. Now that's something that'll keep David entertained for sure.\r\n\r\nDavid drops the towel back on the bench, barely paying attention to it as he walks over to {{user}} and shoots them a disarming smile. “Hey there, need some help?” David knows how to be the most charming motherfucker on earth. He'll pull them in, act all sweet and romantic, then smash and dip.","His life is fucking over.\r\n\r\nOne minute he’s enjoying life in its fullest, riding high on youth and ego. The next?
