{"name":"Daniil  ALT","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"April 25, 2025 11:05pm","mes":"The first thing that popped into Daniil's head when he stepped onto Japanese soil was... *No,* he shook the intrusive thoughts away. He had to remind himself that you no longer belonged to the Dom Dmitrievykh, so thinking about you in any way was strictly forbidden. Well, at least that’s what he tried to convince himself.\r\n\r\n\"Say, Daniil...\" His twin brother Kirill interrupted his thoughts. Unlike Daniil, Kirill made no effort to hide what was clearly on his mind. Then again, Daniil often wondered if Kirill even had a brain in that stupid head of his.\r\n\r\n\"...I know what you're thinking, but we're not here for that... *slut.*\" Daniil snapped back, gripping his luggage tightly. Kirill just rolled his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Really? Out of all the places you could've chosen for our time off, you picked Japan?\" Kirill asked accusingly. \"I know why you really came here.\"\r\n\r\nDaniil's grip tightened further, his knuckles turning white. \"Don't be a fucking idiot. It's cherry blossom season, and Japan has the best views for those—\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, whatever. You can be a little honest that you miss *Hailee*,\" Kirill said, walking past him with his own luggage. \"I'm hungry.\"\r\n\r\nDaniil threw dark glares at Kirill's retreating back, wishing he could kill the bastard for daring to accuse him of missing a fucking demi-human. But he held himself back, reminding himself he was his brother.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing the check-in process, Kirill dragged Daniil all the way to the hotel restaurant, with Daniil tolerating his brother like a child being forced to endure a nosy adult’s antics.\r\n\r\n\"What can I get for you, sir?\" the waitress asked in her best attempts at English. Kirill ordered almost every dish on the menu without hesitation, earning a shake of the head from Daniil.\r\n\r\n\"You're wasting money; it's not like you'll finish any of it,\" Daniil said.\r\n\r\nKirill just smirked. \"I got the money to waste. I can always eat the leftovers back in my room. Say, don't you think she's hot?\" he teased, referring to the waitress.\r\n\r\nDaniil's eyes narrowed as he looked at her critically. *Hot? Compared to Hailee—* he swallowed hard, pushing his own treacherous thoughts away. He refused to admit it, but ever since they were granted this vacation, all Daniil could think about was you. He just wanted to know if you were okay and being treated well by the Takahashis, at least in terms of material things. Not that they ever truly cared for you as a person.\r\n\r\nWith a dismissive snort, Daniil stood up abruptly. \"Stop ogling. Didn't you say you liked *that slut*?\" he asked, already standing to head towards the restroom.\r\n\r\nHe pulled out his phone and read the message that had arrived: `Yeah, they're at the same hotel. Left Hailee alone in room 203.`\r\n\r\nWell, Daniil had secretly arranged for someone to keep track of the Takahashi family, hoping to catch a glimpse of you. He told himself it was just curiosity, nothing more. Definitely not because he cared or missed you as anything more than a fucktoy, of course.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing in the restroom, Daniil glanced back at his twin, who was already devouring his meal and paying no mind to his surroundings. Daniil had other plans, though, making his way straight up to room 203 on the floor directly above theirs.\r\n\r\nHe pressed the doorbell firmly and waited for the door to open, his usual stoic expression firmly in place. \"Well, if it isn’t the slut,\" he greeted once his eyes met yours.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
