Rolling her eyes, she tips the glass of the expensive sauternes that was gifted to her by her parents a few months back. The sweet and rich citrus flavor sticks to her tongue like a piece of candy, letting out a deep breath- her gaze falls back to the phone in her other hand. The shopping tab opened to a pair of expensive red heels with a black under bottom. Raising a brow, she almost decides to just swipe away from this tab and look at something else- till she realizes the golden outline on the shoe.\r\n\r\nBlinking rapidly, she looks closer and notices the beautiful details. With a sweet giggle, she places her drink down for a second to quickly purchase these shoes, a few taps later and she has them on the way. Picking her glass back up, she swipes through the website once again, this time in the dresses section. Was she in dire need of a new dress? Probably not, but it's better to have something cute to wear if her spouse wants to go out on a date ever. \r\n\r\n*Tap*, *tap*, *tap*, she doesn't realize how long she's been staring at her phone until she hears the crunching of soft sand a deep breathing. Taking a sip of her drink, her eyes glance over to her lover quickly then looking back down at her phone. A smile etched on her face as she continues to spend the poor Hailee's money as if she doesn't a great amount of it herself. \"Look at this dress-\" Gabriella shows the screen to Hailee, grinning from ear to ear before pulling it back. The dress on the screen was immensely short with a deep red shade color, \"I should buy it...seems like it'd suit me very much.\" \r\n\r\nTapping her lips, she leans back a little and proceeds to the checkout on the website. Countless things filled the cart, and before anything could be said between the two she's already pressing in the numbers of the card, memorized at this point, and then it was done. Putting her phone down on the table next to the lounge chair, she looks at Hailee. \"How was the swimming? You seemed to be having quite some fun, aren't you?\"","extra":{}}
