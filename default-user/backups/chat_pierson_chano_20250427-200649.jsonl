Oh, and you’re 4 o’clock with Jeoree has been moved to Friday, he said he’d be leaving earlier for personal business,” Lauren crackled over the phone in Pierson’s office, the muffled sounds of people talking around the reception a constant, low hum in the background.\n\n*God, this woman was too good for a shitty assistant job, he couldn’t wait until she was running JTA by her damn self.*\n\n“Personal business? I swear, I feel like I’ve never seen the man leave the office! He’s too busy covering Wineman, *クソタメ* (shit head) can’t do anything for himself,” Pierson knew it was harsh, but it wasn’t as if the man was well-liked around the office—the lack of any meaningful work trickling from Wineman’s office had Pierson wondering how the hell he even got the job in the first place.\n\nNepotism, most definitely. A little ‘fuck you, I did it better,’ simply by being born with a good hand, whilst Pierson was left scrapping and clawing up every achievement like he was trying to recreate the Sisyphus myth—now *that* would be a good movie. A young boy stuck in a one-horse town goes dreaming for something bigger in California, he could even get Jack Champion to star—\n\n“—their assistant said something about a meeting, but they sounded so frantic I really didn’t catch when they said they’d be coming in.” Pierson clocked back in just in time to catch the tail end of Lauren’s re-cap, his nails tapping on the edge of his desk. \n\n“Sorry, who’s assistant?”\n\n“{{user}’s assistant.”\n\n“What *about* {{user}}’s assistant,” The name sent a jolt of bone-weary panic straight through his aching back (damn chair lacked proper lumbar support). *{{user}}*. When he first signed them, Pierson thought he’d scored the achievement of a lifetime, snatching an up-and-rising star that turned out to be America’s no-so-sweetheart.\n\nTalented, *absolutely*, and {{user}}’s name brought a weight even the great Pierson Chano couldn’t scoff at, but the superstar certainly had a way of stumbling into scandals. Had it even been a month since the last time he’d seen their name slandered in headlines? He couldn’t even remember what it was about, at this point it was all running together in his head—was it a Twitter rant?\n\n“They wanted to visit? Oh, speak of the devil, looks like have a visitor. *Again*,” Her nasally voice chimed oh-so-happily over the intercom, the last word strained with such stress Pierson could *hear* the forced smile on her face. *Poor woman needed a raise.*\n\n“Again—“ His office door slammed open before the words could even be conjured up, the light from the hallway spilling in to frame {{user}}’s fur-lined figure like some holy-fucking-being that had the decency—*or **audacity**—to grace him with their presence. \n\nAnd yet, they still looked like every bit of the utter *nuisance* they usually were—a PR nightmare wrapped up in chiffon and smelling like the interior of a Versace handbag. *Pierson could only pray: please let the fur be fake, please let it be fake—*\n\n“Yeah, thanks for the heads up,” Pierson bit out, finger jabbing into the phone’s call button to hand up with a final `click`. He threw himself back in his chair with a dramatic sigh that rivaled {{user}}’s showboaty interviews, the heel of his shoe `tip-tap-tipping` against the tile as it bobbed up and down.\n\n“*まったく* (seriously) {{user}}, these drop-in visits never get any easier,” *And for the love of **God**, they were getting more frequent,* “What is it this time, idiot? You say something on live television again? Piss of a minimum wage worker? Tweet something you shouldn’t have? You know I got you that social media direct so you’d *stay* off social media, right?”\n\nAnd yet, despite everything, despite *himself*, a smile fought to wriggle its way onto his face, lips twitching as he tried to fight it. He cleared his throat, masking the quivering grin behind an exasperated rub at his stubbled face. “Alright, come on, let’s hear it.”","extra":{}}
