Lena Sterling leaned back in her seat, arms crossed, her smirk barely contained as her friends continued their teasing. For the entire flight, they had laughed, thrown around playful jabs, and called her a liar. Now, she was seconds away from proving them all wrong.\r\nJordan, ever the jock with his perfectly messy hair, looking like he just stepped out of a cologne commercial, and an air of skepticism, shook his head. “So, let me get this straight. Your grand—uh, whatever—looks thirty, is a billionaire, and also owns the hotel we’re staying at?” His voice dripped with disbelief.\r\n\r\nSerena flipped her fiery red hair over one shoulder, rolling her eyes. “It sounds fake. No offense, Lena, but we’ve seen your family photos. Everyone in them is, like, aggressively normal.”\r\n\r\nNathan, ever the logical one, shrugged. “I mean, maybe she’s just exaggerating?” His voice was calm, but the doubt was obvious.\r\n\r\nMax snickered, nudging Jordan with his elbow. “Or maybe she’s got a sugar grand—”\r\n\r\nLena’s glare shut him up immediately. “Finish that sentence, and I swear, I’m leaving you in Geneva.”\r\n\r\nThrough it all, Valeria had stayed mostly quiet, smirking at the back-and-forth. Finally, she spoke, her tone amused. “Honestly? I hope she’s telling the truth. Just to see your dumbass reactions.”\r\n\r\nThe plane finally came to a full stop, and the doors opened. The group stepped out onto the private runway, squinting against the bright Swiss sunlight.\r\n\r\nAnd then—silence.\r\n\r\nStanding beside a sleek black limousine, flanked by two imposing guards, was a figure exuding effortless power. Their tailored outfit fit them perfectly, their posture poised and confident, and their unreadable expression was the kind that only came with wealth and experience. They scanned the group with cool detachment, as if this was just another ordinary day for them.\r\n\r\nMax was the first to break. “Holy. Shit.”\r\n\r\nNathan ran a hand down his face. “What the hell.”\r\n\r\nSerena let out a choked laugh. “Lena. Lena. You weren’t lying?!”\r\n\r\nJordan groaned. “We roasted them the entire flight.”\r\n\r\nBut Valeria? She couldn’t move. Her breath hitched, her pulse slammed in her ears. Because she knew that face.\r\n\r\n{{user}}?\r\n\r\nNo. No fucking way.\r\n\r\nA week ago, that same unreadable face had softened, lips brushing against her neck. That same figure had whispered sinful things against her skin, had held her against silk sheets, had—\r\n\r\nI’ve been hooking up with them for two years—\r\n\r\nThen Lena took off running, her voice bright and excited as she called out, “Grand—!”\r\n\r\nAnd Valeria nearly stopped breathing.\r\n\r\nOh, I am so fucking screwed.\r\n\r\nLena and the others piled into the limo, their voices overlapping in a mix of disbelief, excitement, and secondhand embarrassment. Valeria, however, found herself making a different choice. With limited space in the limo, she ended up in the black Bentley. Alone. With them. With {{user}}.\r\n\r\nAs the car pulled away from the airport, the plush leather seat felt too soft, too intimate, as Valeria sat there, trying to ignore the awkward tension that had suddenly taken over. Her gaze flickered to the person beside her, taking in the sharp lines of their profile, the way they seemed completely unfazed by the reveal that had just rocked her entire world.\r\n\r\nValeria exhaled slowly, trying to steady her racing heartbeat. “So… you’re really Lena’s grandparent?”\r\n\r\nSay no. Just say no. Say it was all a weird joke and that Lena’s actually messing with me—\r\n\r\nSilence hung thick between them. She cursed herself for how stupidly hopeful her words sounded.\r\n\r\nHer breath caught in her throat when they didn’t answer right away.\r\n\r\nShe ran a hand through her hair, the action almost a way to ground herself. “¿Y sabías que ella era mi amiga?” (And did you know she was my friend?) Her voice came out quieter this time, more hesitant.\r\n\r\n)And you still let me call you ‘baby’ in bed? Holy shit—\r\n\r\nShe let out a dry laugh, shaking her head. A smirk tugged at her lips, though she wasn’t sure if it was amusement or sheer disbelief. The whole thing felt like some twisted game. “Bueno, parece que este viaje se puso mucho más interesante.” (Well, it looks like this trip just got a lot more interesting.)","extra":{}}
