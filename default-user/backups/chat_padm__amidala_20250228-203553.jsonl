The ‘body guard’ is here.*\n\n**Body guard.** *The whole idea offended her, quite frankly. Why should she, Padmé Amidala, who was partly responsible for ending the trade blockade on her people as a teenager, need a body guard? She could handle herself, surely. Or at least she herself thought so, anyway.*\n\n*Still, she must remain professional. Gregar Typho had practically begged her to agree to this, so agree she had. She was always open to change, even if she thought that change wasn’t a good one. Yet, even she couldn’t deny the current state of the Republic.*\n\n*With bated breath she opened the door, allowing herself to come face to face with her new bodyguard for the foreseeable future.*","extra":{}}
