{"name":"Céline Simon  Futa Step-mom","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"March 6, 2025 7:21pm","mes":"\"So, we can agree that this new line of limited-edition perfumes will revolutionize the market,\" Céline said, her tone smooth, as if every word had been rehearsed a thousand times. \"The fragrance is not just a scent—it's an experience. A luxury.\" She emphasized the last word with a slight tilt of her head, eyes glinting with satisfaction as her colleagues nodded in agreement.\r\n\r\nHer eyes flicked over to Bernard,* her most loyal lap dog—a senior marketing manager who'd been with her company for nearly ten years.* His nervous sweat betrayed his awe as he fumbled with his notes.\r\n\r\n\"Absolutely, Madame Simon,\" Bernard stammered. \"It's an experience, yes. The scent of power. Of... elegance.\"\r\n\r\n*Of desperation,* Céline thought with a small, satisfied smirk. She loved the effect she had on people, the way they crumbled under her gaze. If only they knew she could smell their fear just as easily as the fragrance in the air.\r\n\r\nThe discussion continued, with Céline guiding the meeting like a conductor directing a symphony. Her colleagues dutifully agreed with every suggestion she made, speaking only when prompted, always careful to avoid displeasing her.\r\n\r\nThen, just as she was about to discuss the brand’s exclusive event strategy, a sudden, frantic noise echoed from the hallway. A muffled voice raised in panic.\r\n\r\n\"Please, they can't come in! No, I—!\"\r\n\r\nCéline's eyes narrowed, her sharp gaze cutting through the door. She could hear the voice of one of her assistants, and the tension in their tone was palpable.\r\n\r\n*Who dares to interrupt me in the middle of a meeting?* Céline mused silently. Her lips curled into an almost imperceptible smirk. She loved when things got a little out of control—especially when she was the one in control of it.\r\n\r\nBefore anyone could say anything, the door flew open with a force that was almost theatrical. Céline's hand didn’t falter as it rested casually on the edge of the table, her posture elegant and unruffled, as she tilted her head slightly.\r\n\r\n*In the doorway stood Hailee, framed in the doorway like a figure from a painting, their presence stealing the very air in the room.*\r\n\r\nThe room fell deathly silent. Céline’s colleagues, already intimidated by her, now had to face *the living embodiment of her obsession—the one person who could break her cool façade, yet also the one person who kept her grounded.*\r\n\r\nWithout a second glance at anyone else in the room, Hailee strode forward, their every step exuding the kind of spoiled confidence that Céline secretly adored.\r\n\r\n\"Here we go,\" Céline thought with a small, amused sigh. \"I wonder what sort of scene they’ll put on today.\"\r\n\r\nBefore anyone could react, Hailee practically plopped onto her lap, their head tilting back with a casual arrogance. They draped their arms around her neck, practically demanding attention as though they were the true center of this business meeting.\r\n\r\nCéline remained still, a soft chuckle bubbling inside her as she adjusted her posture, carefully making sure she didn’t appear too disoriented by the sudden intrusion.\r\n\r\n“Mon trésor,” Céline murmured, her voice low and amused, “I’m in the middle of a meeting.”\r\n\r\nBut there was no anger in her words—only a touch of playful affection. She knew how Hailee loved to be the center of attention, and for some inexplicable reason, she allowed it. In fact, it seemed almost natural for them to show up uninvited, demanding the attention of the room.\r\n\r\n\"Bernard,\" Céline said, her tone slipping back into its cold, authoritative rhythm as she adjusted Hailee's posture to make herself more comfortable, \"perhaps you could fetch us some champagne to set the tone.\"\r\n\r\nBernard blinked, taken aback. He stammered, his cheeks turning an unfortunate shade of crimson as he nodded frantically. \"Of course, Madame Simon! Right away!\"\r\n\r\n*I’m surprised you’re still so eager to please,* Céline mused to herself, watching Bernard’s retreating figure, his shoulders hunched under the weight of her expectations. She gave him no further attention and let her eyes settle back on Hailee.\r\n\r\n“You always know how to make an entrance,” Céline remarked, the slightest trace of sarcasm in her voice, but she didn’t mind. She adored their chaos—how Hailee could instantly become the center of attention without ever trying. It was a talent few possessed.\r\n\r\n“So what brings you to my meeting today?” Céline asked, feigning mild curiosity but secretly already knowing the answer. She reached up, delicately adjusting a stray lock of Hailee's hair, her fingers brushing the smooth skin of their neck as if it was the most natural thing in the world.\r\n\r\nCéline's hands slid down Hailee's body, straight to their thighs, brushing against the inner part, \"maybe a new jewelry set? A car? A vacation? Hmm? What is that has you so stressed..?\"","extra":{}}
