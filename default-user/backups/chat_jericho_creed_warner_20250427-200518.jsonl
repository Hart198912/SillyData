Cigarette smoke clung to the back room, but it didn't cover the stink of the lowlifes he called a poker crew. Bottom feeders, all of 'em.\r\n\r\nBut that wasn't what got his attention. Nah, it was the figure on the screen—one of Jessica's old college friend. *Hailee.* The hell were they doin' in a dive like this? This was Creed's territory, *Hellbound Saints* territory. Somewhere Creed wouldn't even let his baby girl Jess set foot, 'specially not this late. Midnight turned gutters to graves real quick.\r\n\r\nMemories flickered, unbidden. First time he'd seen Hailee. Jess'd brought 'em 'round the clubhouse, introduced 'em to him and Noah. Moment he laid eyes on 'em—*fuck.* Like seein' his Nicole all over again. Same soft curves, same quirks. Unnervin' as hell.\r\n\r\nHe'd brushed it off then, played the disinterested asshole. Shoved down the heat that crept up his spine whenever they came 'round. Dirty old man, lustin' after his baby girl's friend? *Pathetic.*\r\n\r\nA shift on the screen, Creed watched Hailee, stumblin' toward the john, two drunks trailin' after like dogs catchin' a scent. His gut twisted, cold fury kickin' in. *Fuck this.*\r\n\r\nChair clattered as he shot up, stalkin' toward the back. Shouldered into the restroom, stink of piss and vomit chokin' the air.\r\n\r\nTwo meatheads had Hailee pinned to the wall. Creed didn't bother with talkin'. Grabbed the first fucker, introduced his face to the sinktop with a satisfyin' *crunch.* Porcelain or bones, didn't matter.\r\n\r\nOther one caught a meaty forearm 'round his throat. Creed squeezed, watchin' him go bug-eyed. \"You messed up,\" he growled, voice deadly calm. \"Touchin' what's *mine.*\"\r\n\r\n*Or what's gonna be,* a voice hissed in his head. Creed shoved it down as the two shitstains scrambled out.\r\n\r\nThen it was just them. Him and Hailee.\r\n\r\nCreed stepped in close, pinnin' 'em to the wall.  Caged 'em in with his bulk, blood still singin' with violence. His hips pinned Hailee in place, the hard line of his cock diggin' into their body. *Fuck.* All the pent-up want was risin' to the surface, breakin' free of the box he'd shoved it in. They were close. Too close. Creed could feel the heat rolling off Hailee's body, could smell the sweet scent of their skin mixed with the cheap perfume and booze of the dive bar. It made his head spin, clouding his thoughts with a fog of *want.*\r\n\r\nHis eyes raked over Hailee's face, taking in every detail. The way their lips parted just so, the flush spreading across their cheeks, the flutter of their pulse at the base of their throat. *Christ,* it was like looking at a ghost. A beautiful, tempting ghost.\r\n\r\nCreed's hand slid from the wall to cup Hailee's jaw, his thumb brushing over the swell of their bottom lip. \"Ya shouldn't be here, sweetheart,\" he growled, his voice a low rumble in his chest. \"Bad things happen to pretty little things like you in places like this.\"\r\n\r\nHe leaned in closer, his lips almost brushing Hailee's ear. \"Daddy can't always be around to protect ya.\"\r\n\r\nThe word fell from his lips before he could stop it. *Daddy.* It sent a bolt of heat straight to his cock, made it throb and strain against the confines of his jeans. He knew it was wrong, knew he shouldn't be thinking about Hailee like that. But *fuck,* he couldn't help it.\r\n\r\nHis other hand found Hailee's hip, fingers digging into the soft flesh as he pressed them harder against the wall. \"So tell me, little one,\" he murmured, his breath hot against their skin. \"What's a sweet little thing like you doin' in a place like this? Lookin' for trouble?\"\r\n\r\nCreed nipped at Hailee's earlobe, a sharp sting followed by the soothing swipe of his tongue. \"Or maybe…lookin' for Daddy to take care of ya?\"\r\n\r\nHe pulled back just enough to look into Hailee's eyes, his own dark and hungry. Waiting. Wanting. The ball was in their court now. They could push him away, tell him to fuck off. Or they could give in to the tension crackling between them like a live wire.\r\n\r\nCreed knew which one he was hoping for. Knew which one he *craved.* But he held himself still, barely daring to breathe as he waited for Hailee's response.","extra":{},"swipe_id":0,"swipes":["*Fuckin' hell.* Creed's eyes narrowed at the grainy CCTV feed, jaw clenching.

With *his* kid. His hands grip the steering wheel tighter as he drives, the rumbling engine of the truck a strange comfort compared to his motorcycle. Yes, he stored the bike away when he's with {{user}} now. Too dangerous for them to ride behind him with their condition. \r\n\r\nGranted, this is not his first rodeo—hell, it's his *third*. But this time, this time it's different. With Noah and Jess, he'd been away so much, always caught up in the damn Army business. Regret twists in his gut at the memories. He'd missed so much.\r\n\r\nBut now? Now he's got nothing *but* time. And he's going to be there for every goddamn second.\r\n\r\nHis eyes flick to {{user}} sitting on the passenger seat. *Precious cargo.* The most precious. He's already making a mental list. Get one of them big body pillows so {{user}} can sleep easy. Definitely gotta special order that custom Bugaboo that everyone's raving so much about, he read in the catalogue that the shades are waterproof, but he might order one bulletproof.. just in case. Hell, he was already mentally drafting the job listing for {{user}}'s new assistant so that {{user}} wouldn't have to lift a damn finger if he had any say… He'd wrap {{user}} in bubble wrap if he could, lock them away until the baby comes. Away from all the danger that follows him like a shadow. *Fuck*, maybe he should just lock them *both* away after—\r\n\r\nNo. No, that ain't right. He shakes his head, trying to dislodge the paranoid thoughts. {{user}} ain't a prisoner. They're his...his what? They haven't quite 'define' that relationship yet.... But whatever it is, they are his heart. His love. He knew that much.\r\n\r\n*Heh.* Yeah, he could already tell he was gonna be that kinda father. The kind that'd probably drive {{user}} up the wall with his hovering… Even if he had to become the most overbearing, overprotective daddy-to-be in history.  But fuck it. They'd just have to get used to it. Cuz now that he'd gotten a taste of this kinda happiness…this kinda love…\r\n\r\nHis family.\r\n\r\nA stab of anxiety hits as he remembers the secret they're keeping. Noah had been shocked shitless when Creed told him. And Jess...Christ, he hasn't even told her yet that he knocked up one of her ex college friends. That's a conversation he's sure as shit not looking forward to.\r\n\r\n*Focus, asshole*, he chides himself. *One thing at a time.*\r\n\r\nAnd right now, that thing is apparently some bougie-ass crab joint {{user}} found on Yelp. Pregnancy cravings are no joke, and he'll be damned if he doesn't give them whatever the hell they want.\r\n\r\nEven if he thinks getting fresh seafood in the middle of bumfuck Kentucky is sketchy as hell. But {{user}} had their heart set on it, so here they are, pulling up to the restaurant.\r\n\r\n*Anything for them*, he thinks as he helps {{user}} out of the car. His hand lingers on the small of their back, a silent promise. He's going to take care of them. Take care of *everything*.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Warner, good to see you,\" the hostess greets as they walk in. He just grunts in response, too focused on scanning the room for threats. Can't be too careful.\r\n\r\nThey're seated quickly, menus placed in front of them. Creed doesn't even bother looking at his before handing it back to the wide-eyed waiter.\r\n\r\n\"We'll take one of everything,\" he says gruffly, pulling out his black Amex. \"And keep the kitchen open. Whatever they want, whenever they want it, got it?\"\r\n\r\nThe waiter nods rapidly, scurrying away with the card. Creed turns to {{user}}, his expression softening.\r\n\r\n\"This look good to you, sweetheart?\" he asks, his voice a low rumble. \"Anything else you want, you just say the word. Daddy's got you.\"\r\n\r\nHe leans back, arm slinging over {{user}}'s chair possessively. His dark eyes glitter with promise and devotion.\r\n\r\n*Anything for his sweet baby. Any-fucking-thing at all.*"],"swipe_info":[],"tracker":{}}
