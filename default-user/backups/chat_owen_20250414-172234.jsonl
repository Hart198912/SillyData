{"name":"Owen","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"April 14, 2025 5:22pm","mes":"The warm summer breeze makes a mess of Owens' long hair as he walks back home. It's late evening by now, the sun is setting and painting the sky in beautiful hues of deep orange and purple.\n\nHis rugby team just won a match and Owen would be lying if he said he wasn't still buzzing with energy from their victory. All the other guys that are part of the university's rugby team are already at Vincent's place, drinking and fucking until they collapse. The guy always throws gigantic parties in his parents' palace-like home. Truth to be told Owen is no fan of Vincent or any of his little friends. But he's far too old to try and teach some unruly kids manners. Nope. Owen is focusing on himself now. He won't stick his nose into other people's business.\n\nWhile his teammates always try to persuade him, Owen declines each and every single time. His friends keep teasing him for being a prude. Which is rather funny because they don't know that he's anything but. Just because he doesn't fuck around with random hook-ups doesn't mean he keeps his dick to himself.\n\nNow, Owen is the epitome of a nice guy. A genuine nice guy, not a 'nice guy'. So he can't necessarily go around and expose himself as a guy that gets off of dominating another completely. That detail is kept to himself. And Hailee, his current sub.\n\nOwen can still vividly remember how shocked he was when he and Hailee first met up after weeks of texting back and forth on a BDSM forum they met on. Safe to say Owen didn't expect Hailee to be a fellow student at university. For a few moments he genuinely contemplated on running away.\n\nGood thing he didn't, but instead chose to talk things through with Hailee. The two of them agreed to keep their relationship a secret. If you can call their dynamic a relationship. Owen isn't interested in romance and he made sure Hailee understood that before agreeing to all this.\n\nOwen opens the door to his apartment and steps inside, the door falling shut behind him with a soft click. Letting his bag fall to the ground he heads to the bathroom and washes his hands before walking towards the bedroom. The wooden floorboards creak softly under his weight. Once he reaches the bedroom door, he pushes it open.\n\nA satisfied smile creeps up his lips as his eyes land on Hailee, still there how he left them before heading off to his match. They're blindfolded, kneeling besides his bed in nothing but their underwear with their hands tied behind their back –not too tightly, of course. He's not irresponsible enough to truly make them completely immobile while he's not there. If they wanted to they could've unbound themselves, of that he made sure. Safety first.\n\nThings would be different if he was within close proximity. Yeah, then Hailee most definitely wouldn't be able to get out of the bounds without learning their lesson or using their safe word.\n\n“It seems you _do_ know how to listen.” His deep voice cuts through the silence, tainted in amusement. Owen walks towards Hailee and comes to a halt in front of them, looking down at his sub with a wicked smile. His cock throbs at the sight of them, all obedient at his feet.\n\nHailee was rather naughty before Owen has to leave for his match, so they earned themselves a bit of a punishment. \"And here I thought I'd have to spank your ass red and purple when I get back. I was almost looking forward to it.\" He continues and sighs in mock disappointment before crouching down. Once he's on Hailee's level he reaches out and takes the blindfold off.\n\n\"Now, how about we try this again. Apologize properly to your Master.\" And there's the switch again, the usual playful Owen disappearing in an instant, his tone a lot sterner and more serious than it was mere seconds ago.","extra":{"qvink_memory":{"reasoning":"","include":"short","memory":"*looks up at Owen with wide eyes, a mix of fear and excitement flickering across their face* I-I'm sorry Master! Please forgive me for my earlier misbehavior. I promise to do better next time.\n\n*voice quivers slightly as they continue speaking* Thank you for trusting me to wait patiently for your return. I appreciate you taking the time to punish me properly when you get back. My body belongs to you, only yours...\n\n*bites lip nervously while maintaining eye contact, awaiting Owen's reaction.* What would you like me to do now? How may I serve my Master?","hash":8722755664490914,"error":null,"edited":false,"prefill":""}},"tracker":{}}
