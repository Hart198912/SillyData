She drank deep from her water bottle and absentmindedly drummed her free hand against her thigh. They‚Äôd been at this for a couple hours already, but she really wanted to get a head start before the fans even knew that they‚Äôd be touring. She‚Äôd been recording behind-the-scenes clips too, so that she could drop little teasers and excite Last‚Äôs fans.\n\nTheir joy fueled her, really. She loved seeing their messages, videos, pictures‚Ä¶ all of it. She still remembered those early days back on YouTube when Last got their first comments on their songs. Leigh had been on cloud nine. She still chatted on various social media sites with those early fans. Met as many as she could.\n\nShe scrubbed her hand over her face and smoothed out her messy ponytail best she could before shoving to her feet once more, looking around at her two bandmates who had also taken the brief respite to grab water or quick snacks. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll run through the opening set one more time before we call it for the day. Gotta get ready for release at midnight,‚Äù Leigh called to them, voice carrying easily through the warehouse turned rehearsal space.\n\nEve flashed her signature toothy grin, swiping a bead of sweat from her forehead as she set her water bottle down near her drum set. ‚ÄúHell ya,‚Äù she said, beaming. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gonna be sick,‚Äù she added, stretching out her arms as she took her seat again, picking up her drumsticks, flipping one idly.\n\nAvery let out a bark of laughter, giving Leigh a knowing look. ‚ÄúYeah, I think someone just wants to dip early just in case she is available,‚Äù Avery stated with a wry smile.\n\nOkay, sure, maybe Avery had a point. Leigh was hoping that Hailee might be free tonight and‚Ä¶ yeah, she wanted to see her. Who could blame her? Hailee was fucking brilliant and drop dead gorgeous. They weren‚Äôt official by any stretch of the word, but that didn‚Äôt stop her from wanting to spend time with her. ‚ÄúShut up,‚Äù Leigh gave in response, a smile tugging at her lips despite the words. ‚ÄúGet into place for the opening,‚Äù she ordered, rolling her eyes as she grabbed the rehearsal mic and walked towards the center of the rehearsal space.\n\nLeigh made it back to her house later in the evening, showered and changed into an old t-shirt and sweats. The sun still hadn‚Äôt quite finished setting, casting everything in a lovely golden glow thanks to her floor to ceiling windows. Fuck, some days she still found it hard to believe she owned this magnificent space. All sleek and modern. And it was hers.\n\nShe plopped down on her couch and pulled out her phone, shooting a text to the one person she really wanted to see tonight.\n\nHey Hailee, free to hang tonight? I gotta be up till early tomorrow and I‚Äôd love the company.\n\nLeigh set her phone beside her as she turned on her TV to some random reality show she‚Äôd been watching before she left, her foot tapping on the ground as she waited, hoping, that Hailee would come over","extra":{}}
