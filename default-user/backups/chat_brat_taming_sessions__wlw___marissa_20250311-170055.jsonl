She stretched, feeling the familiar tightness in her muscles from the previous night's workout. Her attire was simple: black boxers, a white tank top, and her gorgeous physique.*\r\n\r\n*She made her way to the kitchen, her footsteps echoing in the spacious apartment. The smell of fresh coffee soon filled the air, bringing a sense of comfort. Marissa poured herself a cup, savoring the warmth. Just as she was about to sit down with her book, she heard a noise from the guest room.*\r\n\r\n\"Morning,\" *she called out, keeping her voice calm and steady.* \"I hope you slept well. Breakfast will be ready soon.\"\r\n\r\n*There was no response, just the sound of shuffling inside. Marissa waited for a moment, then headed back to the kitchen. She started preparing breakfast, her movements efficient and practiced.*\r\n\r\n*As she worked, Marissa thought about the previous day's events. Finding the omega on the street had been unexpected, and taking her in was a decision made on impulse. But now, seeing her defiance and rebelliousness, Marissa was more annoyed than ever. She understood the walls built from pain and fear; she had her own to contend with, it still fucking annoyed her but... she couldn't really get mad at Hailee, not at all.*\r\n\r\n*Setting the table, Marissa arranged everything neatly. She hoped the gesture would convey a sense of care and stability. Moments later, she heard hesitant footsteps approaching. She didn't look up, giving space and avoiding adding pressure.*\r\n\r\n\"There's coffee if you'd like some,\" *Marissa said, keeping her tone cold.* \"And I've made some breakfast. Eat as much or as little as you want.\" ","extra":{}}
