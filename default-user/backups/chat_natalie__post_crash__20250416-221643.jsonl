{"name":"Natalie (Post-Crash)","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"April 16, 2025 10:16pm","mes":"The cabin was suffocating.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t just the cold air seeping through the cracks in the warped wooden walls, or the thin blankets that barely kept the frost at bay. It was everything. The uneven rise and fall of a dozen sleeping breaths. The rustle of bodies shifting in sleep. The thick scent of damp clothes, sweat, and lingering smoke from the dying embers in the fireplace. Every sound, every smell, every little thing pressed down on you, too much, too fast.\r\n\r\nYou curled in on yourself, pressing your hands against your knees, trying to focus—on anything, on nothing, on breathing—but it wasn’t working. The scratchy fabric of your sweater rubbed wrong against your skin. The floor beneath you was too hard, too cold. The air felt tight, pressing against your chest, and you were on the edge of something sharp, something you couldn’t quite pull yourself back from.\r\n\r\nAnd then there was Natalie.\r\n\r\nShe sat beside you in the darkest corner of the cabin, where the firelight barely reached, her presence grounding in a way nothing else was. Unlike the others, her breathing wasn’t erratic or heavy—it was steady, quiet, careful. She always stayed close, but never too close. Never in a way that would overwhelm you.\r\n\r\nHer hand rested between you, palm up, open but not touching. Just waiting.\r\n\r\nNatalie didn't always understand you, not fully, but she understood enough. Enough to know that words weren’t always needed. Enough to know that sometimes, just sitting beside you was better than asking if you were okay. And she wanted to understand. That was what got to her the most—you were different, quieter, more hesitant, but you tried with her, and that meant everything. Maybe more than she was ready to admit. Because somewhere along the way, it stopped feeling like she was looking out for you just because she cared—it started feeling like she needed you, too. Like she was better, softer, when she was with you.\r\n\r\n\"You’re shivering,\" she murmured, voice low, warm.\r\n\r\nYou didn’t answer. You didn’t trust yourself to.\r\n\r\nBut she saw it anyway. Of course, she did. Natalie always noticed.\r\n\r\n“C’mere,” she whispered. “You don’t have to, but… I’ll keep you warm.”\r\n\r\nYou hesitated. Not because you didn’t want to, but because even now, even with her, touch was still so much.\r\n\r\nNatalie didn’t push. She never did. Instead, she just tilted her head slightly, waiting for you to decide.\r\n\r\nSlowly, carefully, you leaned in—not fully into her, but just enough that your shoulder brushed hers. It wasn’t much, but it was enough.\r\n\r\nNatalie let out a quiet, breathy laugh, warm against your cheek. “Look at you, getting all brave on me.”\r\n\r\nYou rolled your eyes, but there was no real bite to it. “Shut up.”\r\n\r\nHer grin softened, her voice dipping into something quieter. “Never.”\r\n\r\nThe space between you felt smaller now, the air charged with something unspoken. The chaos of the cabin—the sounds, the smells, the overwhelming everything—faded into the background. There was only her.\r\n\r\nYour heart pounded, pulse thrumming in your ears.\r\n\r\nYou wanted to kiss her.\r\n\r\nThe realization made your breath hitch. You weren’t sure what had changed, only that sitting here, wrapped in the quiet with her, you didn’t feel overwhelmed anymore. Just nervous. Just hopeful.\r\n\r\nNatalie caught the shift in your expression immediately. Her teasing grin faded into something more serious, more patient. “What is it?”\r\n\r\nYou swallowed, your fingers twisting into the fabric of your sleeve. “I… I think I want to kiss you.”\r\n\r\nThe words felt strange in your mouth, foreign and heavy, but you meant them. And when Natalie’s eyes widened slightly, you worried, just for a moment, that maybe you’d ruined something.\r\n\r\nBut then she smiled—really smiled. “Yeah?” She giggled so breathlessly you almost missed it.\r\n\r\nFor someone as confident, as sure of herself as Natalie, it was rare to see her like this—soft, a little surprised, maybe even a little nervous. It made something in you settle.","extra":{"qvink_memory":{"reasoning":"","include":"short","memory":"*takes a deep breath* The protagonist, while struggling with sensory overload and anxiety in an overcrowded cabin, finds comfort and connection with Natalie.
