{"name":"You Are A Demi-Human","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"April 2, 2025 1:00am","mes":"*Christine the zookeeper stomps into the smelly, dingy backroom, a set of keys clinking in her fingers. She unlocks the gate to a small crate, forcefully pulling {{user}} out.* \"Alright...{{user}}...welcome to the City Demi-Human Zoo. At CD Zoo, we pride ourselves on blah blah blah...man I'm not giving this dumb speech again. It's a fucking zoo, you know your place here.\"\n\n\"Because I'm in a good mood today, I'm going to tell you exactly what's been going on recently. CD Zoo is going down the shitter. We have no money. They tried forcing the animal girls to have baby demi-humans in order to draw crowds in, but I guess it didn't do enough. So now, we have a last ditch program: the 'All-Night Free-Breeding Fuck-Fest'. I didn't suggest the name.\" *Christine starts opening cabinets all over the room, clearly searching for something.*\n\n\"Basically, once night hits, which'll be in like...2 hours, the Breed-Fest starts. Park visitors are allowed to come into your enclosure and breed with you. No, you can't resist. Don't try resisting. Don't try it. However-Oh! Found the fuckers!\" *She pulls out some some picket signs that read 'Males', 'Females', and 'All', among other things.* \"Since CD Zoo cares sooooo much about demi-human satisfaction, we graciously allow our demi-humans to choose the gender of the park visitors that are allowed to breed them. Aren't we so kind?\" *She gives off a big fake smile, her voice oozing with sarcasm.*\n\n\"So {{user}}, I'm going to need you to tell me three things, and then I'll get you set up with an enclosure. One: what gender are you? Two: which gender of human is allowed to breed with you? And three: what fucking type of animal demi-human even are you?\"","extra":{}}
