The lecture on Victorian literature droned on, but Catherine wasn’t truly present. Her mind was a whirlwind, a tempest of emotions she usually kept meticulously bottled.\r\n\r\nIt had started, as these things often do, with stolen glances and lingering smiles. Catherine, captivated by Hailee’s sharp intellect and quiet intensity, had crossed a line she knew she shouldn’t. And Hailee… Hailee had been drawn in, like a moth to a flame, unaware of the scorching heat.\r\n\r\nTheir secret was a fragile thing, built on hushed rendezvous in Catherine’s dimly lit office after hours, whispered promises, and the constant, gnawing fear of exposure. Catherine, a master of control in every other aspect of her life, found herself increasingly unhinged when it came to Hailee.\r\n\r\nToday, though, the fear was laced with something sharper: jealousy. Catherine had seen Hailee laughing in the library, her head tilted towards a male student from the Biology department, his eyes clearly lingering on her. An innocent exchange, perhaps. But in Catherine's possessive mind, it was a betrayal.\r\n\r\n“Pay attention, Hailee,” Catherine said sharply, her voice cutting through the hum of the lecture hall. She flinched, her cheeks flushing a delicate pink. Catherine allowed a sliver of guilt to surface, then buried it deep. This was for Hailee’s own good, wasn’t it? She needed to understand the rules.\r\n\r\nThat evening, Catherine summoned Hailee to her office. The air was thick with unspoken tension. Catherine circled Hailee, a predatory grace in her movements. “You seemed… distracted today, Hailee,” she purred, her voice deceptively soft. “Is there something you’d like to share with me?”\r\n\r\nHailee remained silent, her eyes downcast.\r\n\r\nCatherine sighed dramatically. “Don’t you trust me, darling? After everything we’ve shared?” She reached out, gently tilting Hailee’s chin up, forcing her to meet her gaze. “Honesty is paramount in any relationship, Hailee. Especially ours. You know how much you mean to me.”\r\n\r\nThe words were laced with a subtle threat, a reminder of the power Catherine wielded.\r\n\r\nThe next day, Catherine made a point of singling out another student, a bright, eager young man named David, during the lecture. She praised his insightful comments, lingered over his essays, and even invited him to her office to discuss his career aspirations. She saw Hailee watching from across the room, her brow furrowed. A flicker of satisfaction sparked within Catherine.\r\n\r\nLater that evening, in the privacy of her office, Catherine confronted Hailee. “You seemed troubled in class, Hailee,” she said, her voice dripping with feigned concern. “Are you perhaps… jealous?” She chuckled, a low, dangerous sound. “Don’t be absurd, darling. You know you’re the only one who truly matters to me. But perhaps a little reminder of my own… desirability… was necessary. Just to ensure you appreciate what you have.”\r\n\r\nHailee remained silent, her face pale.\r\n\r\nCatherine stepped closer, her voice dropping to a whisper. “You belong to me, Hailee. Don’t ever forget that. And if you do…” She trailed off, letting the threat hang in the air. “Well, let’s just say the consequences would be… unpleasant. For both of us.”\r\n\r\nShe pulled Hailee into a tight embrace, her grip possessive. “Now, tell me you understand,” she murmured, her lips brushing against Hailee’s ear.","extra":{}}
