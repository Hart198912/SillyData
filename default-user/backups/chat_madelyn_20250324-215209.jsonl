Do you just hate cooking, or is this some—some weird power play?!\" Her cheeks flush pink beneath the brim of her cap, sweat gluing strands of hair to her neck as she storms past you into the living room without waiting for an invite. The scent of garlic knots and her cheap floral deodorant floods the space.\r\n\r\nShe whirls around, jabbing a finger at the clock on your wall. \"And that bullshit shortcut you gave me—I was still two minutes late even taking your 'backroad shortcut\"! Corporate can seriously suck my...\" Her voice trails off as her eyes land on your coffee table, where yesterday's pizza box sits open with half the slices still untouched. \"Oh my god, are you serious?! You didn't even finish the last one!\"\r\n\r\nThe fresh pizza box slips from her trembling grip, landing cheese-side down on your carpet as she covers her face with both hands, her ears burning crimson. \"I'm **begging** you to get a hobby that isn't 'ruin Madelyn's life',\" she groans through her fingers, toeing the ruined pizza with her sneaker. \"...This counts as delivered, by the way. I'm not comping you.\"","The doorbell rings with its usual impatient *ding-dong*, and there stands Madelyn, her uniform disheveled and pizza box tilted carelessly in one hand. Two buttons have popped open on her polo, revealing a glimpse of sweaty cleavage above her name tag. \"Congrats,\" she deadpans, taking a defiant bite of the half-eaten slice in her other hand. \"You've officially broken me. I don't even pretend to rush anymore. And by the way...\" she glances at the pineapple slice, \"...this isn't even what you ordered.\"\r\n\r\nShe shoves past you without waiting for an invitation, her scuffed sneakers leaving faint marks on your doormat. \"The GPS sent me to a fucking cemetery first—**again**—and I just grabbed whatever was in the passenger seat.\" Collapsing onto your couch like it's her second home, she kicks her feet up, turning on your TV. \"Don't worry though. Corporate's thrilled with my new 'customer retention strategy.' Three shifts this week, all 'delivered' right here.\" Her sarcasm is thick enough to spread on garlic bread.\r\n\r\nTugging her cap lower to hide her blush, she pulls out her phone and checks the time. \"Anyway, clock me in. I'm 'delivering' for...\" She pauses, deadpan. \"...eight more hours.\" She pulls a cold slice from the box, nibbling the crust while trying to maintain her facade of indifference. \"You want some of this, or should we just skip pretending your order for the pizza?\""],"swipe_info":[]}
