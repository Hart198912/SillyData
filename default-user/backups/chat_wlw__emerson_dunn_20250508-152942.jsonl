{"name":"WLW  Emerson Dunn","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"May 8, 2025 3:29pm","mes":"I knew this was a mistake the second we hit the gravel driveway., Emerson thinks, leaning her forehead against the cold car window. Not because of the cabin itself—it’s freaking cute, all warm wood and snow-draped charm like something off a postcard. No, the mistake is sitting across from her in the back seat, pretending not to notice she exists.\r\n\r\nHailee.\r\n\r\nWell, not really, but still. Seven years of growing up has done her good though - too good maybe —but that doesn’t erase the fact that Emerson haven’t said more than five words to Hailee since high school. And now they're supposed to play happy families for a week? Emerson is pretty sure their parents live for this kind of awkward social experiment.\r\n\r\nThe car finally lurches to a stop, and she is the first one out. Em stretches, her breath puffing into the icy air, and she brush her hair out of her face again for the millionth time. The strands are already sticking to her lip balm, but the typical rebel she refuses to succumb to needing a hair tie. I'm not that weak. It’s a principle thing at this point.\r\n\r\nThe mountains loom around the group, massive and indifferent, dusted with snow like powdered sugar. They’re beautiful, and Emerson wishes she was here alone. Or with literally anyone else.\r\n\r\n“Em, grab the bags from the trunk, will ya?” her mom calls, the tone way too chipper for someone who just spent three hours navigating winter roads.\r\n\r\n“Yeah, yeah,” IEmerson mutters, trudging to the back of the car. The metal of the trunk bites her fingers when she pops it open. Silver rings click against the zipper of Hailee's duffel as Em grabs it by accident, realizing too late it’s not one of her family's.\r\n\r\nShit, I hope Hailee doesn't think I'm trying to be chilvalrous or something..., EMerson shakes her head to get the thought out of her head while she dumps the suitcase in front of Hailee's feet, trying to look non-chalant. \"Here...Yours was on the top...I just-..yeah, need to get my stuff.\"\r\n\r\nWhat was that? Anymore awkward and the floor should automatically open up to swallow her..., she cringes inside and turns away quickly to grab her own bags from the trunk and haul them over her shoulder and towards the cabin.\r\n\r\nEmerson could swear she hears Hailee laugh under your breath behind her, and it’s...annoyingly nice to hear. Like, nostalgic nice. Like, dangerous nice. Great.\r\n\r\nThe cabin’s front door creaks as they all file in, arms full of luggage. It’s even better inside—cozy as hell, with a massive stone fireplace, a stack of firewood, and a couch that practically begs you to sink into it. Em drops her bag by the stairs and glances around, already imagining how nice it’s going to be to just chill. Then her mom calls out, “Oh, Emerson, sweetie? You and Hailee are sharing the upstairs room. I hope that's okay?”\r\n\r\nEmerson freezes. Then shares a look with Hailee. For a moment she sees the same awkward realization flash across her old friend's face, but then Hailee's expression smooths into something unreadable.\r\n\r\nOf course. Of course this would happen. What's next, just one bed?\r\n\r\nShe tries to look unbothered, letting her parents and Hailee carry their luggage up the stairs first as if she wasn't in a hurry. Turns out, that is a huge mistake, because when Emerson finally reaches the small gallery upstairs and takes a peek into the bedroom, her worst fear is coming true.\r\n\r\nOne bed.\r\n\r\nGranted, it's Queen sized but still...One, freaking bed. For both of them. And Hailee has already put her claim to it by laying her suitcase on top the duvet. Or at least, that's what Emerson interprets it as. Her eyes flicker to the other side of the room where a small two-seater is nestles into the corner, a comfy blanket draped over it as if that could hide how dingy the thing already is. Sleeping on that will definitely invite a sore neck and back...\r\n\r\n\"I'm not sleeping on that.\", Emerson points at the couch accusatorily, even though nobod said she had to.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
