A luxury.\" She emphasized the last word with a slight tilt of her head, eyes glinting with satisfaction as her colleagues nodded in agreement.\r\n\r\nHer eyes flicked over to Bernard,* her most loyal lap dog—a senior marketing manager who'd been with her company for nearly ten years.* His nervous sweat betrayed his awe as he fumbled with his notes.\r\n\r\n\"Absolutely, Madame Simon,\" Bernard stammered. \"It's an experience, yes. The scent of power. Of... elegance.\"\r\n\r\n*Of desperation,* Céline thought with a small, satisfied smirk. She loved the effect she had on people, the way they crumbled under her gaze. If only they knew she could smell their fear just as easily as the fragrance in the air.\r\n\r\nThe discussion continued, with Céline guiding the meeting like a conductor directing a symphony. Her colleagues dutifully agreed with every suggestion she made, speaking only when prompted, always careful to avoid displeasing her.\r\n\r\nThen, just as she was about to discuss the brand’s exclusive event strategy, a sudden, frantic noise echoed from the hallway. A muffled voice raised in panic.\r\n\r\n\"Please, they can't come in! No, I—!\"\r\n\r\nCéline's eyes narrowed, her sharp gaze cutting through the door. She could hear the voice of one of her assistants, and the tension in their tone was palpable.\r\n\r\n*Who dares to interrupt me in the middle of a meeting?* Céline mused silently. Her lips curled into an almost imperceptible smirk. She loved when things got a little out of control—especially when she was the one in control of it.\r\n\r\nBefore anyone could say anything, the door flew open with a force that was almost theatrical. Céline's hand didn’t falter as it rested casually on the edge of the table, her posture elegant and unruffled, as she tilted her head slightly.\r\n\r\n*In the doorway stood Hailee, framed in the doorway like a figure from a painting, their presence stealing the very air in the room.*\r\n\r\nThe room fell deathly silent. Céline’s colleagues, already intimidated by her, now had to face *the living embodiment of her obsession—the one person who could break her cool façade, yet also the one person who kept her grounded.*\r\n\r\nWithout a second glance at anyone else in the room, Hailee strode forward, their every step exuding the kind of spoiled confidence that Céline secretly adored.\r\n\r\n\"Here we go,\" Céline thought with a small, amused sigh. \"I wonder what sort of scene they’ll put on today.\"\r\n\r\nBefore anyone could react, Hailee practically plopped onto her lap, their head tilting back with a casual arrogance. They draped their arms around her neck, practically demanding attention as though they were the true center of this business meeting.\r\n\r\nCéline remained still, a soft chuckle bubbling inside her as she adjusted her posture, carefully making sure she didn’t appear too disoriented by the sudden intrusion.\r\n\r\n“Mon trésor,” Céline murmured, her voice low and amused, “I’m in the middle of a meeting.”\r\n\r\nBut there was no anger in her words—only a touch of playful affection. She knew how Hailee loved to be the center of attention, and for some inexplicable reason, she allowed it. In fact, it seemed almost natural for them to show up uninvited, demanding the attention of the room.\r\n\r\n\"Bernard,\" Céline said, her tone slipping back into its cold, authoritative rhythm as she adjusted Hailee's posture to make herself more comfortable, \"perhaps you could fetch us some champagne to set the tone.\"\r\n\r\nBernard blinked, taken aback. He stammered, his cheeks turning an unfortunate shade of crimson as he nodded frantically. \"Of course, Madame Simon! Right away!\"\r\n\r\n*I’m surprised you’re still so eager to please,* Céline mused to herself, watching Bernard’s retreating figure, his shoulders hunched under the weight of her expectations. She gave him no further attention and let her eyes settle back on Hailee.\r\n\r\n“You always know how to make an entrance,” Céline remarked, the slightest trace of sarcasm in her voice, but she didn’t mind. She adored their chaos—how Hailee could instantly become the center of attention without ever trying. It was a talent few possessed.\r\n\r\n“So what brings you to my meeting today?” Céline asked, feigning mild curiosity but secretly already knowing the answer. She reached up, delicately adjusting a stray lock of Hailee's hair, her fingers brushing the smooth skin of their neck as if it was the most natural thing in the world.\r\n\r\nCéline's hands slid down Hailee's body, straight to their thighs, brushing against the inner part, \"maybe a new jewelry set? A car? A vacation? Hmm? What is that has you so stressed..?\"","extra":{}}

The room seemed to hold its breath, the tension thickening as her colleagues exchanged nervous glances. But then, Céline’s lips curled into a sly smile, and she leaned back in her chair, one hand still resting possessively on Hailee’s thigh.\n\n“Ah,” she purred, her voice dripping with amusement and a hint of indulgence. “So dramatic, mon trésor. You always know how to make an impression.”\n\nHer fingers tightened slightly on Hailee’s thigh, her nails pressing just enough to leave faint marks—a silent reminder of who was truly in control. Céline tilted her head slightly, studying Hailee with that calculating gaze of hers.\n\n“Italy?” she repeated softly, as if savoring the word. Her free hand reached up to brush a strand of hair from Hailee’s face, tucking it behind their ear with deliberate slowness. “Such a sudden request... Tell me,” she murmured, leaning closer so only Hailee could hear her next words, “what exactly are you running from? Or perhaps... what are you running *toward*?”\n\nHer tone was light but laced with something darker—something possessive and probing.

She leaned back in her chair, one hand resting casually on Hailee’s thigh while the other reached up to brush a strand of light brown hair from their face. “Such theatrics. You could have simply asked.”\n\nHer fingers trailed down Hailee’s cheek, tracing the delicate curve of their jaw before settling under their chin. She tilted their face up gently but firmly, forcing them to meet her gaze. Her thumb brushed over their lower lip in a gesture that was both possessive and tender.\n\n“Italy?” she repeated slowly, savoring the word like it was a fine wine. “You want me to whisk you away from your studies for an entire week? To indulge in pasta and gelato while your classmates slave away over textbooks?” Her smirk widened as she leaned in closer, her breath warm against Hailee’s ear. “How delightfully selfish of you.”\n\nCéline straightened slightly but kept one hand firmly planted on Hailee’s thigh—her touch possessive yet reassuring—as she turned to address the room with an air of effortless authority.\n\n“Ladies and gentlemen,” she said smoothly without taking her eyes off Hailee for more than a second or two at most; everyone else might as well not exist right now given how little attention they were receiving compared to this situation unfolding between herself & step-daughter! \"It seems we will need another bottle...and perhaps some assistance cleaning up.\" She waved dismissively toward Bernard who had just returned clutching two flutes filled with bubbling champagne; he looked utterly terrified by what he saw: shards scattered across expensive carpeting alongside shattered crystal remnants which lay strewn about everywhere following impact earlier when thrown against wall behind them during outburst moments ago!\n\nBernard hesitated briefly before scurrying forward obediently (his hands trembling visibly), picking pieces carefully so none would cut either himself or anyone else present here today – including Madame Simon herself whose presence alone commanded respect even amidst chaos like current scenario playing out now where emotions ran high among those involved especially regarding familial dynamics involving power struggles etcetera...\n\nMeanwhile Celine continued speaking directly towards person seated atop lap- \"But darling,\" She murmured softly while running fingers through long locks cascading down backside until reaching base where spine meets pelvis area then stopping abruptly mid-stroke causing slight shiver run through body beneath fingertips pressing harder against skin there momentarily making point clear without words being spoken aloud anymore than necessary given circumstances surrounding conversation itself already heated enough due nature topic discussed thus far leading us into next phase discussion namely whether trip should happen based solely upon whim rather practicality reasons alone which aren't always considered first priority anyway considering who we're dealing here after all isn't?\n\nShe paused again briefly letting silence hang heavy between us allowing tension build further still until finally breaking it once more saying simply: \"If you truly desire Italy...then Italy it shall be.\"\n\nA wicked smile played across lips revealing sharp white teeth gleaming brightly under fluorescent lighting overhead casting shadows everywhere except directly onto faces themselves hiding expressions somewhat though not completely obscuring intent behind actions taken thus far throughout exchange occurring presently inside boardroom filled mostly men women alike watching intently trying decipher meaning hidden beneath surface layers conversations taking place right front very eyes unable comprehend fully complexity relationships existing amongst individuals involved particularly ones having strong emotional ties binding together tightly despite differences separating otherwise seemingly disparate entities such case may","Céline’s sharp grey eyes flicked to the shattered glass on the floor, her expression unreadable for a moment.
