His head slugged forward, thumb brushing along the carved-out hole of his pipe. \n\n*It burned*, he realized, and with a slow shrug he pulled his singed thumb off to examine the charred greenery in the bowl. Shit was strong, stronger than it should’ve been, flashing through his head and making the world around him look like one of those white strobe lights—it felt like his entire body was moving at 3 frames per second between the blinking blackouts, yet his mind was running 150.\n\n*Laced, probably.*\n\nHe thought the deal was *wayyyy* too good to be true, all the empty pockets sucked dry from the overpriced *bullshit* “Mom and Pop” dispensaries (which granted, gave out some **potent** shit) having him turning back to a plug he hadn’t seen since sophomore year of high school. \n\nBut he wasn’t about to pay 60$ for an eighth. With Niko still suckling off Mommy dearest’s financial *teat*, he wasn’t exactly prone to overspending on shit Evelyn would cut him off for in a heartbeat.\n\nIncluding laced weed.\n\nHe turned the pipe in his hand, letting out a low exhale that burned like melted sugar in his lungs, clinging to every alveolus like it was *determined* to give him early-onset COPD. Fuck it, not like he wanted to stick past his 30s regardless, no need for good lungs when he hadn’t the time to use them.\n\n*Wonder what the hell is in this.* It was a simple thought, pondering over what *exactly* was causing the nerve-biting, electric-like hum through his body. He pursed his lips, tongue mulling over a single, muffled word. “Hailee.”\n\nYeah, Hailee would know, wouldn’t they? Asshole dipped their toe in every pot that **was** ‘hardcore drugs’, could probably pinpoint what it was like a pretentious hippie selling grass behind the counter. *“What are you looking for? Head high or body high? Relaxation or focus? Yap, yap, yap—”*\n\nYeah. Yeah, *no*, they would **definitely** know.\n\n“Hailee!” Niko called out, voice reverberating through the empty house and right back into his ears, met with nothing but the hushed sound of the neighbor’s yappy dog. Not even his parents—*parent*, he reminded bitterly—answered him. \n\nAny other spoiled brat would’ve thrown a shit fit if they found out their Mom (and her ‘Hubby’) were going on a month-long trip to Europe. *S’il vous plait, I’ll be Paris during Christmas! We’ll bring home pictures so it’ll feel like you were there!*\n\nNiko, as bitchy as he could be, would’ve punched a hole in the hotel wall if he had been forced to go. Always having his Mom breathing down his neck, not having the space to get **fucked** up. And Hailee…\n\nHaving his parents around always stuck a wedge between the two, kept him from fully wrapping them up in his sticky-sweet embrace. He wanted to keep them glued to his side—always with him, always beside him, always **there**.\n\n“Hailee!” He shouted louder, shoving himself up from his ruffled bed to trudge the short distance to Hailee’s propped-open door. No lock, they weren’t *allowed* to have one. Turns out that when you keep falling down the slippery slope of drug use, you aren’t really given the privilege of *basic* privacy.\n\nHailee, with all the “get-out-of-my-room!”’s, couldn't even have the door shut now. Thank you, rehab. \n\n “Hailee! I know you’re awake, you got that therapy shit at 3. Your Dad keeps calling to annoy me about it,” He pushed open the door, and sure as shit, there they were still buried under the blankets of their bed. Half-awake, but still *technically* up and going. \n\n“Hey, try this out. I think this shit’s laced and I was wondering if you’d know what the hell was in it. Come on, scooch over.” \n\nHe slid in beside them, not caring as they grumbled out some exhausted, half-formed protest. “Hey, look alive! Your Dad said you can’t sleep past noon anymore.”\n\nAnd he wasn’t about to get in trouble just to cover their ass. He offered the pipe up, pressing the mouthpiece against their lips. “Alright, you sit up and I’ll light it, okay?”","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
