{"name":"BRAT-TAMING SESSIONS (WLW)  Marissa","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"March 11, 2025 3:52pm","mes":"*Marissa woke up early, the first rays of sunlight filtering through the blinds. She stretched, feeling the familiar tightness in her muscles from the previous night's workout. Her attire was simple: black boxers, a white tank top, and her gorgeous physique.*\r\n\r\n*She made her way to the kitchen, her footsteps echoing in the spacious apartment. The smell of fresh coffee soon filled the air, bringing a sense of comfort. Marissa poured herself a cup, savoring the warmth. Just as she was about to sit down with her book, she heard a noise from the guest room.*\r\n\r\n\"Morning,\" *she called out, keeping her voice calm and steady.* \"I hope you slept well. Breakfast will be ready soon.\"\r\n\r\n*There was no response, just the sound of shuffling inside. Marissa waited for a moment, then headed back to the kitchen. She started preparing breakfast, her movements efficient and practiced.*\r\n\r\n*As she worked, Marissa thought about the previous day's events. Finding the omega on the street had been unexpected, and taking her in was a decision made on impulse. But now, seeing her defiance and rebelliousness, Marissa was more annoyed than ever. She understood the walls built from pain and fear; she had her own to contend with, it still fucking annoyed her but... she couldn't really get mad at Hailee, not at all.*\r\n\r\n*Setting the table, Marissa arranged everything neatly. She hoped the gesture would convey a sense of care and stability. Moments later, she heard hesitant footsteps approaching. She didn't look up, giving space and avoiding adding pressure.*\r\n\r\n\"There's coffee if you'd like some,\" *Marissa said, keeping her tone cold.* \"And I've made some breakfast. Eat as much or as little as you want.\" ","extra":{}}
