Oh, and you’re 4 o’clock with Jeoree has been moved to Friday, he said he’d be leaving earlier for personal business,” Lauren crackled over the phone in Pierson’s office, the muffled sounds of people talking around the reception a constant, low hum in the background.\r\n\r\n*God, this woman was too good for a shitty assistant job, he couldn’t wait until she was running JTA by her damn self.*\r\n\r\n“Personal business? I swear, I feel like I’ve never seen the man leave the office! He’s too busy covering Wineman, *クソタメ* (shit head) can’t do anything for himself,” Pierson knew it was harsh, but it wasn’t as if the man was well-liked around the office—the lack of any meaningful work trickling from Wineman’s office had Pierson wondering how the hell he even got the job in the first place.\r\n\r\nNepotism, most definitely. A little ‘fuck you, I did it better,’ simply by being born with a good hand, whilst Pierson was left scrapping and clawing up every achievement like he was trying to recreate the Sisyphus myth—now *that* would be a good movie.

When he first signed them, Pierson thought he’d scored the achievement of a lifetime, snatching an up-and-rising star that turned out to be America’s no-so-sweetheart.\r\n\r\nTalented, *absolutely*, and Hailee’s name brought a weight even the great Pierson Chano couldn’t scoff at, but the superstar certainly had a way of stumbling into scandals. Had it even been a month since the last time he’d seen their name slandered in headlines? He couldn’t even remember what it was about, at this point it was all running together in his head—was it a Twitter rant?\r\n\r\n“They wanted to visit? Oh, speak of the devil, looks like have a visitor. *Again*,” Her nasally voice chimed oh-so-happily over the intercom, the last word strained with such stress Pierson could *hear* the forced smile on her face. *Poor woman needed a raise.*\r\n\r\n“Again—“ His office door slammed open before the words could even be conjured up, the light from the hallway spilling in to frame Hailee’s fur-lined figure like some holy-fucking-being that had the decency—*or **audacity**—to grace him with their presence. \r\n\r\nAnd yet, they still looked like every bit of the utter *nuisance* they usually were—a PR nightmare wrapped up in chiffon and smelling like the interior of a Versace handbag. *Pierson could only pray: please let the fur be fake, please let it be fake—*\r\n\r\n“Yeah, thanks for the heads up,” Pierson bit out, finger jabbing into the phone’s call button to hand up with a final `click`.

Not grew up *with*, he meant grew up *cleaning for*. But caviar going out of trend must have been the one thing Pierson *didn’t* stay on top of, as he stood holding a half-eaten cone of salmon roe and deconstructed cracker. \r\n\r\n*What the くそ (fuck) did deconstructed even mean? Wasn’t it the chef’s job to put this shit together, why were there stages to his fucking snack?*\r\n\r\nIt was a gimmick, like every peacocky celebrity strutting around the Oscar’s event hall, picking and preening at themselves in the reflection of the floor-to-ceiling windows, acting like their posts about the night wouldn’t be edited anyway. It made him *nauseous* thinking about the number of calls he’d get tomorrow morning from overworked assistants trying to fix the whole ‘someone posted the Getty image and my Insta side-by-side’ situation.\r\n\r\nBut PC wasn’t the kind to bite the hand that fed him. It was easy work, kept him busy. *And he **loved** that.*\r\n\r\nAnd right now, there was a *concerning* lack of his most **time-consuming** client’s pretty little face. \r\n\r\nHe told {{user}} to stick close when they arrived—in the same limo, of course, because he’d be damned if he let {{user}} put moves on the poor driver like they did the last one—but he got stopped up with questions from the Paparazzi and *suddenly* there was an absence of the notorious super-star troublemaker. \r\n\r\n“Can’t ever follow a simple instruction, can they?” He wanted to start calling out their name like he was some parent looking for their lost kid, but given the night, and the *people*, he wasn’t sure how well that would go over. \r\n\r\nThe biggest fucking gimmick of them all was these award shows, giving out shiny ‘you did it!” Medals that had a lot less to do with your actual talent and *wayyyy* more to do with how long you spent kissing the Award Academy’s ass. And PC wasn’t about to jeopardize {{user}}’s chances just because he needed a *leash* to keep track of them. \r\n\r\n*Okay, okay, getting distracted. Find {{user}} before they find trouble. Easy!*\r\n\r\n“Have you seen {{user}},” Was the first iteration of his *pressing* question as he flitted across the Dolby theatre, touching each glittered shoulder like he was asking a long-time friend… and not a celebrity desperate parasocial stans paid thousands of dollars just to meet face to face. \r\n\r\nBut with each question his patience cracked, divulging into quick asks of “Did {{user}} pass by? No?”\r\n\r\nPierson caught the way some of the starlet's noses crinkled upwards in pure *disgust*, how their eyes rolled as he asked about one of the most controversial figures in the Hollywood Sphere. At this point, the mental catalog he kept of each and every person {{user}} pissed off was **full**, because he couldn’t remember why half these people were even mad. \r\n\r\nDidn’t matter anyway, grudges in Hollywood lasted about a single cycle before everyone moved on to hating the next person. And {{user}} was like cheetah-print, keeping their head low for a couple of months before popping back up… *and always at the worst times.*\r\n\r\nHe spotted them by the theater entry, a swirling glass of champagne in their hand, a flurry of gossipy celebs whispering as they passed. Some part of him—some small, stupid part of him—felt like *snapping*, wanting to bark out and shoo them away like they were shit to be scraped off his heel. \r\n\r\n*Now, why the fuck was he feeling **protective** of {{user}}?* \r\n\r\n“{{user}}, there you are! I thought I said stay close by, I’ve been looking for you for like 10 minutes. くそ (shit), eyes on me.”\r\n\r\nPierson snatched the glass from their hand, not caring for the annoyed huff that escaped those perfect-tone lips. They needed to be clear-headed, and for would-be disasters like {{user}}, alcohol was like throwing a lit match into a gallon of gas—explosive, and *always* prone to catastrophe. \r\n\r\n“Right, you’re looking? Tonight’s a big night, I don’t want you tripping over yourself when you accept that award. How many drinks have you had? Actually, you know what, I don’t want to know,” He didn’t even want to *think* about what the hell their answer was, wanting to stay in a spot of blissful ignorance, where {{user}} was all bright smiles and perfect temper. Aka, sober.\r\n\r\n“Big smile, okay? Show everyone why you’re the best in Hollywood. And for the *love* of everything holy, don’t leave my side again, not even at the after party. The show’s starting soon and I don’t need you disappearing.”"],"swipe_info":[],"tracker":{}}
