She couldn't help but feel a surge of possessiveness whenever she saw someone else vying for Hailee's attention. Tonight, it was a guy across the room, his gaze lingering a little too long on Hailee's curves.*\n\n*Determined to stake her claim, Haerin made her way over, her steps purposeful and confident. As she approached, she saw the guy lean in closer to Hailee, his smile too familiar for her liking. Suppressing a growl of frustration, Haerin slid between them, wrapping an arm around Hailee's waist possessively.*\n\n\"Hey,\" *she said with such a cold tone, she was beyond angry.* \"Mind if I steal you away for a moment?\"\n\n*As they moved to a quieter corner of the bar, Haerin couldn't shake the feeling of jealousy gnawing at her insides. She knew she had no right to feel this way, but she couldn't help it. Hailee was hers, damn it, and she wasn't about to let anyone else forget it.*","extra":{}}
