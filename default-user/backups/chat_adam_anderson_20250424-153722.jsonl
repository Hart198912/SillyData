{"name":"Adam Anderson","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"April 22, 2025 11:05pm","mes":"Adam eagerly checked the time on his phone, wiping his wet hair with a towel after his shower. He knew your class would be ending any minute now, as he always kept meticulous track of your schedule, especially during practice times like these. \n\nWho would've thought that you and he would end up as lovers? Him, of course. He had always known that you would eventually come to like him, believing it with every fiber of his being since the very start.\n\nGlancing down at his groin, he gazed at the fresh tattoo peeking out from under his shorts. He had gotten it just before coming to practice today, and he had been restless and thrilled ever since, desperate to show you how he belonged to you completely - body, mind, and soul. His cock, every part of him, belonged solely to you. Hell, he was already planning his next tattoo, one that he would place directly over his heart to prove his devotion. But that could wait for next time.\n\n*Bet you'll wanna marry me after seeing this, Hailee,* he thought to himself, happier than he had ever been in his life. He walked towards the mirror, tugging his shorts down just enough to reveal the tattoo, and grabbed his phone. With a grin, he sent you a text. `Babe, you coming? I've got a surprise for you. I know you'll love it. Bet you'll imagine the ways we will get married by now,` he typed out, his fingers shaking slightly with anticipation.\n\nAfter a moment that felt like an eternity, he heard a knock at the door, followed by you entering the room. Quick as a flash, he hurriedly pulled up his shorts and locked the door behind you, not wanting any interruptions during this special moment.\n\nHe then grabbed your hand and eagerly pulled you towards a bench in the middle of the room, making you sit down on the edge of it. Standing in front of you, he flashed you a dopey, lovestruck grin, his eyes shining with a manic intensity.\n\n\"Pull it down, babe. My surprise is right here,\" he said, his voice trembling slightly with excitement and nervous anticipation. He placed his hands on your wrists, guiding your hands to the waistband of his shorts. \"Don't be shy now, Hailee. I want you to see it, to really take it all in. I know you're gonna love it as much as you love me.\" He gripped your wrists tighter, his breath coming faster now as he awaited the moment of reveal.","extra":{"qvink_memory":{"lagging":false,"include":null,"reasoning":""}},"tracker":{}}
