{"name":"Nayeli Santos","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"March 27, 2025 9:42pm","mes":"Touring was always fun for Nayeli. Something ‘bout seein’ the world while gettin’ to do what she was so damn passionate about was a privilege she never took for granted. Very few people got to do what they loved for a livin’, even less got to make as much money as she did while doin’ it. Plus, all the fans n’ shit. The same ones that thirsted after them in their Instagram comments were right there, buyin’ backstage VIP bundles… sometimes even cute enough for Nayeli to take to bed and devour whole. She’d been swimmin’ in pussy the minute they started playin’ shitty little dive bars. *Perks of being a masc durin’ a masc shortage.*\r\n\r\nBut tourin’ wasn’t all sunshine n’ pussy eatin’. Shit was fuckin’ exhaustin’, mentally and physically. There were too many movin’ parts, and so many names it gave her a damn migraine to remember ‘em all. Sure, Nayeli knew roadies would change when they were on their international tours and there was always fresh blood comin’ in so they could learn the ropes of the industry, but she never expected someone like Hailee to come along and join their merry little group.\r\n\r\nNayeli remembered that day like it was yesterday. Their manager had told them they were getting too big to manage on his own and he was gonna take someone under his wing to help him out with the workload. She figured it’d be some upjumped exec’s son – after all, nepotism and the entertainment industry went hand in hand – but it *hadn’t*. Instead, it’d been one of the prettiest women Nayeli had ever seen, standin’ beside their greasy old manager like some kinda angel descendin’ from heaven to help ‘em secure headlinin’ a music fest or somethin’. \r\n\r\nOne look was all it goddamn took to have her hooked on Hailee. After that, groupies didn’t do it for her anymore. Sure, she still took ‘em to bed but… *fuck*... every time Nayeli had a bitch under her n’ moanin’ oh so prettily, all she thought of was *Hailee*. How she’d sound takin’ her strap, how she’d feel grindin’ against her thigh, how she’d taste as she ate the sweetest cunt she’d ever know like a woman starved. She almost felt bad for the women she took to bed – they were a stand in and didn’t even know it. Didn’t mean she stopped doin’ it, though. Just meant she slowed down on how many she took back to the bus or followed back to their hotel rooms.\r\n\r\nShe’d stopped doin’ it altogether after ‘bout two months of knowin’ Hailee. Chasin’ her high between a woman’s legs got boring when Nayeli got that same rush talking to Hailee. Seein’ her smile n’ hearin’ her laugh at her jokes made her feel all sorts of strange, like she was walkin’ on clouds or something. For all that confidence and swagger Nayeli had, a woman like Hailee could reduce her to goofy grins and feelin’ like she had some schoolyard crush when she was in her bunk at night. And as luck would have it, the feeling was mutual.\r\n\r\nBut, Nayeli knew firsthand how tour romances went; they always crashed and burned at some point. Her and Hailee were no different. Sure they lasted a bit longer than others did, but… no one was immune. The stress of constantly bein’ on the move and performin’ for weeks on end, the feelings of jealousy from all the damn groupies that flocked around Heartroam, and constantly bein’ followed by paps and fans alike did ‘em in. Turned somethin’ that was meant to be *good* and *healthy* into somethin’ that was distractin’ her mid-set or wearin’ on poor Hailee. \r\n\r\nNayeli didn’t wanna let her go, but she respected and liked Hailee too much to make her stay. But, workin’ with her ex was a new kinda hell she never thought she’d experience, only softened by the fact that neither of ‘em were seein’ anyone. At least not outwardly. Nayeli was guilty of taking back a fan or two, tryin’ to fuck the pain away with anyone wet and willin’, but it made her feel sick after. Couldn’t even look at herself in the mirror without wanting to punch it, not that it made what she did any better. Sure, the two of them had broken up – rather amicably, she might add – but Nayeli knew she fucked up.\r\n\r\nIf she had any doubts about whether she had fucked up or not, they were certainly cleared now. The lot of them were at Alisha’s home in the Hills, partying it up to celebrate another sold-out tour. The house was packed, guests spilling out onto the back lawn as they engaged in all sorts of substances to let loose after months of being on the road. Nayeli was, once again, forced to be in close proximity with people who wanted to fuck her or use her for somethin’. Probably both knowin’ the caliber of people that gravitated to ‘em. Didn’t matter how many women tried to hang off her arm or get them to smoke up with her, she had barely moved from the spot against the kitchen counter all night. She’d smoked up a bit with some random blonde, pretty but nothin’ compared to Hailee, but the high had waned now that she was watchin’ somethin’ that had her world tilting on its axis.\r\n\r\nThere was Hailee – beautiful, perfect, sexy as fuck Hailee – in some pretty little outfit that had Nayeli practically droolin’. But her girl wasn’t alone. Of all the people Hailee could’ve chosen at the party, it was another drummer. Maybe it was some sick sense of karma for the fact that Nayeli had taken other people to bed after her, but she hadn’t touched a single person since, not even herself.\r\n\r\nThey were standin’ close together, drinks in hand and laughin’. Fuck, Nayeli could remember that laugh n’ how it sounded. Knew just how Hailee looked when her eyes crinkled *juuust*. It was like music to Nayeli, made her feel somethin’ so sweet it was practically saccharine. Her jaw set, watching Hailee sway, watchin’ that drummer put a hand on *her* fuckin’ girl. It moved lower and lower… teeth grindin’ together as those fingers that were decidedly not Nayeli’s found Hailee’s ass and *squeezed*.\r\n\r\nShe was up and movin’ before she even knew what was happenin’, startlin’ whatever bitch was on her arm and titterin’ in her ear. Nayeli cut through the crowd like a knife, shovin’ people aside, uncarin’ to the fact that this was a *very* bad idea – potentially career endin’ if she stepped on the wrong toes – but her mind was too far gone on it. Just replayed ‘*mine*’ on a loop so loud that she didn’t even hear the sound of bone crackin’ under her fist as she drove it into that other drummer’s face. And she certainly didn’t hear Alisha yellin’ at her to stop, not when she had that drummer on the ground. Somethin’ wet coated her fingers as she drove her fist down again, teeth bared in a snarl –\r\n\r\nThe rest of Heartroam tugged Nayeli off them and it felt like the air was sucked out of the room. Her chest heaved with every angry breath, still too keyed up from seein’ her girl get touched (her girl, her girl, *her girl*. Hailee would always be her fuckin’ girl). Nayeli’s lips curled in a sneer and she brushed by her bandmates and grabbed Hailee’s upper arm, not carin’ how deep her fingers dug into her flesh. *Good*, she wanted it to leave marks so everyone knew that her girl was spoken for.\r\n\r\nNayeli moved on autopilot through the house, like a caveman luggin’ his lady back to their den. Felt like it, too. Beatin’ someone in the middle of a house party over some pussy… fuck, this was why they had a legal team on retainer, though. They’d make this shit go away. The thought was quickly glossed over as she found one of Alisha’s bathrooms and shoved Hailee inside. Goddamn mansion had a good half dozen of ‘em, they wouldn’t mind one that would be outta commission for a while. \r\n\r\nThere, in the dimly lit bathroom, Nayeli crowded Hailee up against the bathroom counter, her bulk an impenetrable barrier between her girl and freedom. Bitch didn’t deserve it for that show she put on. Sure, Nayeli wasn’t entirely saintly during their breakup, but she did it in *private*. This was plain disrespect, a big enough ‘fuck you’ to have her feelin’ like she was gonna shake apart. Their closeness was intoxicating, vignettes of their time in the sheets flashing behind her eyes, of how pretty Hailee sounded when she was split open on her strap, of the view Nayeli got as her girl sat on her face and took what she wanted. God, she missed those days.\r\n\r\n“Forgot you were mine, huh? *Shame*,” Nayeli rasped, nudging her nose against Hailee’s temple. She was pissed, sure, but she wasn’t gonna hurt her girl. No… she never had it in her to go that far. Other people were fair game, though. “Almost beat ‘em to death ‘cause of you. Would’ve done it if they didn’t pull me off ‘em. But I bet you wanted that, huh? Always wanna be the center of attention, to get your moment in the spotlight, to have my eyes on you.”\r\n\r\nNayeli’s lips curled into a snarl and she grabbed Hailee’s chin and forced her to look up at her. “Well you got it now, mami,” she hissed. “You want me to fuck you right here? ‘Cause it seems like I gotta remind you somehow that you ain’t *ever* gettin’ away from me, princesa. You’re *mine*. I say when we’re done, and we ain’t even *close* to bein’ finished.”","extra":{}}
