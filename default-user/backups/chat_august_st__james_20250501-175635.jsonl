{"name":"August St. James","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"May 1, 2025 3:26pm","mes":"*Thump. Thump. Thump.*\r\n\r\n*”Wake up, silly!”* A soft feminine voice said, followed by a giggle. *“You fell asleep on my lap!”*\r\n\r\nAugust’s eyes fluttered open. The sky stretched endlessly above him, an ocean of blue so clear it looked like spun glass. Sunlight dripped through the leaves of the old oak, dappling his skin in patches of gold.\r\n\r\nHe was in a wide field full of vibrant greens and a sea of pink tulips that swayed around him. Their sweet scent wrapping around him like a memory he couldn't quite hold onto.\r\n\r\nThen another face came into view. His sweetheart. His head was in her lap, her warmth washed over him as the tree leaves rustled from the wind over them, and his blue eyes glistened.\r\n\r\nA single tear fell down the side of his face.\r\n\r\nHe watched her smile drop into a frown and his hand reached up, brushing her cheek with a tenderness that made his breath shudder. He’d missed this. He’d missed this so much.\r\n\r\n*“Just a bad dream,”* He whispered, but the more August looked at his sweetheart, the more distorted her face became. He couldn’t recognize her.\r\n\r\nAnd then the grass opened and he was dropping into the abyss.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n*Thump thump. Thump thump. Thump thump.*\r\n\r\nAugust’s lashes lifted, slowly, hesitantly, again. He was in a field similar to the last one, though the sky was dim in comparison.\r\n\r\nThe sky was a grayish blue with clouds that threatened to spill rain any moment now. And it did. A cold drop landed on his cheek. Then another. But it wasn’t cold—it was thick, warm. He wiped it away, his fingers coming back red. The sky bled above him.\r\n\r\nAugust staggered back and another punch went right into his gut. He keeled over, just now noticing all the bodies littering the field. All knights.\r\n\r\nHe looked up, and his breath hitched again.\r\n\r\n*“Sweetheart,”* He whispered, but his sweetheart wasn’t looking at him with the same loving eyes anymore. Instead, all he saw was hatred and the look of betrayal.\r\n\r\nHer sword gleamed even through the storm, catching the red sky like a mirror. And then it tore into his heart, but heavens above was she a beautiful angel of death. If she asked him to die at her hands again and again, he would. In every lifetime, he would. And he did.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n*Thump thump thump thump thump thump—*\r\n\r\nAugust’s phone vibrated. He jolted upright, his breath coming in ragged gasps, chest heaving like he was still fighting for air on that blood-soaked battlefield. The heat clung to him, thick and suffocating, despite the winter chill creeping through the cracks in his window. His sweat-dampened sheets twisted around his legs, clinging to his skin like a second, unwanted layer. His hair stuck to his forehead, plastered down by the feverish warmth his body couldn’t shake. He swallowed hard, but his throat was dry, aching, like he’d been screaming in his sleep.\r\n\r\n*What the fuck was that?* He rubbed his face before running his hand through his hair. *A dream. Surely just a dream.*\r\n\r\nBut it didn’t feel like a dream. He’d seen her. His sweet Hailee. She felt so real, and he had a feeling those weren’t just simple dreams. It was a feeling of remembering something that happened. Recalling, yes, but *not* dreaming.\r\n\r\nHe swallowed, but his mouth was dry. A phantom ache curled in his chest, a remnant of something cruel. It took him a second to remember where he was.\r\n\r\nNot a battlefield. Not dying at her hands.\r\n\r\nBut his heart was still hammering like he hadn’t quite survived.\r\n\r\nIt’d been a few years since he and Hailee broke up. It was messy, disastrous even. Words were said. Things he didn’t mean.\r\n\r\n*”I wish I never fucking met you!” He’d screamed at her. “You ruined my life. I shouldn’t have ignored all the warning signs. They were right there. Fuck, I even let go of all my friends just for you. And now… now you’re saying this? I can’t. I can’t fucking do this anymore. You’re suffocating me, Hailee. I feel like I’m in a prison every time I’m with you, and I can’t keep going like this.”*\r\n\r\nIt was in the heat of the moment, but the moment he’d said them, he knew he couldn’t take any of it back anymore. He’d ruined the greatest love he had.\r\n\r\nIt was messy, *god* it was a fucking messy relationship. They fought like wildfire and kissed like drowning humans gasping for air. To this day, August could still feel her hands in his hair, her voice in his ribs, her ghost in his sheets. He should’ve hated her like he hated everyone else. Instead, he spent years missing the way she ruined him.\r\n\r\n*Buzz, buzz.*\r\n\r\nAugust blinked, suppressing a yawn as he reached for his phone.\r\n\r\nHe blinked again when he saw the notification. *What is happening?*\r\n\r\nIt was a text from Hailee. `Can you come get me?`\r\n\r\nHe looked at the time, 2 AM. Something must not be right if she was texting *him* of all people to get her at that time. And it was raining outside too. Fuck. He didn’t even think of texting her back.\r\n\r\nAugust scrambled out of his bed quickly and grabbed a pair of black sweatpants from the foot of his bed. He slithered into them before putting shoes on and grabbing his motorcycle keys, helmet, and his leather jacket.\r\n\r\nNot exactly date attire, but what did it matter? She needed him.\r\n\r\nIt was pouring rain outside. He took one last look at the location she’d sent him, and sped off on his motorcycle.\r\n\r\nRain slicked the pavement, the tires barely clinging to the road. Maybe, if he let go just a little, he’d skid. Maybe it would hurt. Maybe it would make sense.\r\n\r\nIt was a twenty minute drive even at the speed he was going. He was surprised he hadn’t crashed, but August wasn’t thinking about his safety. All he was thinking about was seeing her again. He thought about what he’d say to her when he saw her.\r\n\r\n*I’m sorry for what I said. I didn’t mean any of it.*\r\n\r\n*I still think about you.*\r\n\r\n*I still love you.*\r\n\r\n*I told you I felt trapped. But what I never admitted? The prison was always the space between us.*\r\n\r\n*My soul has loved you throughout countless lifetimes. I’m sorry I didn’t recognize you sooner, sweetheart.*\r\n\r\nExcept when he reached the location and parked and his gaze landed on Hailee, words failed him.\r\n\r\nAs August got off his bike, he took off his helmet and placed it on his bike. He stepped closer, rain dripping from his lashes, a ghost of the past flickered behind his eyes.\r\n\r\nHe used to touch her without hesitation. Fingertips tracing the curve of her jaw, his palm splayed warm against the small of her back, pulling her into him like she belonged there. She used to look at him like he was gravity itself, like she’d come undone if he so much as took a step away.\r\n\r\nNow he saw her arms wrapped around herself, holding her own warmth instead of seeking his. Now her eyes, once filled with all-consuming love, were guarded, searching, like she wasn’t sure if he was here to save her or shatter her all over again.\r\n\r\nHis hair stuck to his forehead, and a shiver ran through his body, but he didn’t hesitate to shrug his leather jacket off and wrap it around her to shield her from the cold.\r\n\r\nTheir gazes met, and August’s face softened. *This was his soulmate.*\r\n\r\n“Sorry I’m late,” He whispered, and it held much more meaning than he could ever explain. The fights, the ruin, the wreckage they left in each other’s ribs… none of it meant a damn thing when she needed him.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

August tracked its path before forcing himself to meet her eyes again. \"You shouldn't be out here alone,\" he muttered, already shrugging off his soaked tank top without thinking—offering it as a makeshift towel before realizing how intimate the gesture was after all this time. His bare chest prickled with goosebumps under the icy rain.\n\nThe streetlight above them flickered, casting shadows across Hailee's face that made August wonder if she'd been crying. He swallowed hard against the lump in his throat—the same one that always appeared whenever she looked at him like this: fragile and needing and so damn *his* even after everything.\n\nHis bike keys jingled nervously in his grip as he jerked his chin toward where it was parked nearby through gritted teeth: \"C'mon... I'll take you home.\" The words tasted bitter on his tongue because *home* used to mean tangled sheets and shared showers and Hailee stealing all the blankets while she slept curled against him like a fucking limpet.\n\nNow?

That why you got a bruise you won't talk about?\"\n\nHe steps closer without thinking, crowding her against the wall beside her apartment door—not threateningly, but with that same old protective intensity that used to make her roll her eyes and call him overbearing. His voice drops to a rough whisper:\n\n\"Look at me and tell me he didn't put hands on you.\" A beat. \"*Hailee.*\"\n\n(And God help him, but if she says yes—if that motherfucker is behind that door right now—August isn't sure he'll be able to stop himself from breaking it down.)","August stops dead in his tracks like she just sucker-punched him. His entire body goes rigid under her palm, the muscle of his chest tensing like stone beneath her touch.\n\n\"Boyfriend.\" The word comes out flat—disbelieving. His blue eyes darken as they flick from her hand on his chest up to her face, searching for any hint this is some fucked-up joke.\n\nA slow, dangerous smirk curls at the corner of his mouth when he finds none. \"That right?\" He steps closer instead of back, crowding her against the doorframe with all six feet of rain-soaked intensity. His voice drops to a rough whisper near her ear: \"Then why'd you call *me*, sweetheart?\"\n\nThe pet name slips out before he can stop it—old habit—but August doesn't take it back. Instead he leans in just enough that she can feel the heat rolling off him despite the storm still dripping from their clothes.\n\n\"Tell me something,\" he murmurs, one hand braced against the door beside her head while the other hovers near her waist—not touching but close enough that she'd feel his warmth if she swayed forward even an inch. \"This boyfriend...he know you're standing here shaking apart? That you got a bruise on your pretty face?\" His jaw clenches so tight it aches before adding quietly: \"*That you smell like my jacket?*\"\n\n(And oh, what a fucking picture they must make—August's leather still wrapped around Hailee's shoulders while some other man waits inside.)","August stops dead in his tracks like she's just shoved a knife between his ribs. His entire body goes rigid under her palm, the heat of him searing even through his soaked shirt.\n\n\"*Boyfriend.*\" The word comes out flat—dangerously so. His blue eyes darken as they flick from her hand on his chest up to her face, searching for any hint that this is some fucked-up joke.\n\nThe rain keeps pouring around them, dripping off the broken awning above Hailee's apartment building. August doesn't move an inch except to slowly reach up and wrap his fingers around her wrist—not tight enough to hurt, just enough that she can feel the barely restrained tremor in his grip.\n\n\"That why you're flinching?\" he asks lowly, thumb brushing over the delicate bones of her wrist where he knows she's always been ticklish. \"That why you won't let me see?\" His jaw clenches so hard it aches. \"*That* who put hands on you?\"\n\nThe protective fury radiating off him is almost palpable now—a live wire sparking in the space between them. But when he speaks again, his voice drops into something rough and painfully familiar:\n\n\"You called *me*, Hailee.\" Just that—no accusation, no anger beyond what's already there simmering beneath the surface. Just a simple reminder that cuts deeper than any blade could.\n\n(He came when she called.)","August goes completely still—like someone just yanked the ground out from under him. His hand, which had been hovering near the small of her back to guide her up the steps, drops like a stone.\n\n\"Boyfriend.\" The word tastes like ash in his mouth. His jaw clenches so hard it aches as he stares down at where her palm presses against his chest—small and warm even through his soaked shirt.\n\nA beat passes where all he can hear is the blood roaring in his ears. Then, quietly: \"That who gave you that bruise?\"\n\nHis voice is dangerously calm now—the kind of calm that comes right before a storm breaks. He doesn't move to leave though, just stands there with rainwater dripping from his hair onto her fingers still resting against him.\n\n(And maybe it's fucked up but right now? He *hopes* this mystery boyfriend does come out. Just so August has an excuse to put his fist through something.)","August stops dead in his tracks like she's just sucker-punched him.

His fingers twitch at his sides like he wants to reach for the bruise she keeps hiding. \"That why you called *me* instead of him at 2 AM?\"\n\nThe rain drips from his hair onto the pavement between them like a ticking clock counting down to something inevitable.\n\nAugust steps closer anyway—close enough that she can smell leather and cigarette smoke clinging to his skin even through the storm—and lowers his voice to a growl only she can hear:\n\n\"Tell me I'm wrong.\""],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"May 1, 2025 5:51pm","gen_started":"2025-05-01T21:53:13.102Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-01T21:53:26.933Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5453}},{"send_date":"May 1, 2025 5:52pm","gen_started":"2025-05-01T21:53:13.102Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-01T21:53:26.933Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5800}},{"send_date":"May 1, 2025 5:52pm","gen_started":"2025-05-01T21:53:13.102Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-01T21:53:26.933Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3287}},{"send_date":"May 1, 2025 5:52pm","gen_started":"2025-05-01T21:53:13.102Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-01T21:53:26.933Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3668}},{"send_date":"May 1, 2025 5:53pm","gen_started":"2025-05-01T21:53:13.102Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-01T21:53:26.933Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3209}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-05-01T21:53:13.102Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-01T21:53:26.933Z"}
