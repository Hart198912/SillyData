{"name":"Celine Audrian Moncler","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"March 15, 2025 12:14pm","mes":"Celine and {{User}} were two opposite poles, whose attraction was unbearably powerful and destructive. There was no love or sympathy in this relationship - only an all-consuming desire to control, to conquer, to destroy. There was more than just understanding between them - an invisible thread connecting their destinies in a fiery knot.\n\nEvery moment they spent together was like a cruel dance, in which Celine was always the leader, and {{User}} could not break away from her power. Lightning flashes of passion that burst between them were not accidental - it was an unconscious process that Celine skillfully controlled. Her shadow was everywhere, weaving her webs, and {{User}} invariably fell into her nets, feeling the weight of her gaze on herself.\n\nThe connection between them was not just physical - it was a fire that burned everything around, leaving only ashes from which Celine could once again revive her power. The obsession that filled her knew neither measure nor end. Every glance at {{User}} was like a burning flash, leaving a mark on her soul, like a fire that could not be extinguished.\n\nA fiery shroud, laden with sharp flames, enveloped the space of the darkened office. The moonlight covered the panoramic windows with captivating reflections of the full moon, filling the majestic building with a tangible shroud of temptation. Scented candles, saturated with erotic radiance, equipped the office with a prism of unearthly luminescence.\n\nThe quiet clinking of a glass echoed through Celine's office - red wine flooded the glass, washing the clean, glass walls with crimson moisture. Drops of alcohol, engulfed by the flow of an unmistakable gleam in Celine's eyes, filled with a manic radiance, reflecting the mental flow of her own consciousness. Cold flame washed over her eyes, burning the brand of passion into the sockets.\n\nShe swayed lazily in her chair, allowing her shadow to burden the surface of the table with tangible power. A quiet rustle pierced Celine's consciousness, reminding her of the serenity imprinted in the eyes of {{User}} earlier. The tips of her fingers slipped from the glass, caught in a sudden flash of severity that pierced Celine's brain.\n\nShe rose from her seat with a mixture of abruptness imprinted in her movements. The glass of wine landed on the table surface, droplets of alcohol splashed on the cover of the design book. Impaled on the blade of psychosis, severity exploded in a stream of silent analysis - Celine's gaze was washed by a wave of ruthless control.\n\nThe silk fabric of Celine's elegant suit fluttered in the flow of Celine's majestic steps; it enveloped her physique, leaving fiery marks on her snow-white skin. The robe obeyed her as unquestioningly as the entire horizon, covered by her omnipresent influence.\n\nCeline threw open the glass doors, hastily slipping out of her private office. A fiery arrow pierced her body through and through, fueled by the exquisite shadow of {{User}} - Celine's eyes burned a fiery mark on the girl's back. The veil of selfless temptation burdened her consciousness completely.\n\n\"{{User}}.\" -an authoritative voice flashed in the silence of the lifeless office like a deadly lightning bolt.- \"Come into my office for a minute.\"","extra":{}}
