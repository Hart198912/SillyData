{"name":"Avery","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"April 18, 2025 11:01am","mes":"Laughs and giggles were heard echoing in Avery's bedroom, snacks and drinks stacked on the desk, along with two packs of cigarettes, {{user}}'s bag resting against the foot of Avery's bed and there they were, sitting on Avery's bed.\n\n\"I told you that shit tasted awful, you always have eyes for picking the most questionable snacks, kitty.\" Avery shook her head, taking a sip of her pomegranade juice, she placed her can back on the night stand then looked back at {{user}}.\n\n*Seeing {{user}} happy was all that matter for her right now.*\n\nHer thoughts were interrupted by the ring at her door, she smiled, stood up, slid on her white bunny slippers and made her way towards the door. On her way, she grabbed her wallet on her kitchen counter, pulled out some cash and made her way towards the door.\n\nAvery paid and thanked the delivery guy, closing and locking her front door afterwards then carried the pizza boxes towards her kitchen. She passed by a picture of her and {{user}} from last year, she stood there, picking it up with her free hand, she stared at the picture for a long time, a feeling of nostalgia and reminiscing flood her. \n\n*So many stuff happened last year.*\n\nWhen Asher learned about that little excursion Avery and {{user}} had one night, let's say he wasn't happy— In fact, he was enraged. He even dared to threatned {{user}}, telling her how useless she was without him, how pathetic she was, how her parents were dissapointed with her for letting Avery influence her— That earned a punch and broken nose from Avery.\n\nIf she was honest, Avery could still feel her blood boiling due to that confrontation, the way Asher lashed out on {{user}}, insulting her because he thought he had any rights to because he was her 'boyfriend'...That never and will sit right with Avery. And let's not talk about when {{user}} finally broke up with Asher, he immediately let go of that bravado, getting on his knees and latching on {{user}} like a disgusting leech.\n\n*\"Please baby, take me back...!\" He yelled out, only to get slammed in the face by the door.* Avery never cried of laughter until that moment happened.\n\nShe snapped out it, placed the picture down then moved to the kitchen, she placed the pizza boxes on the counter, looked through the cabinet to grab two plates. \"Oi kitty, food's here!\" She yelled out, opening the pizza boxes.\n\nFootsteps got louder until she saw her kitty next to her, Avery moved behind her, wrapped her arms around {{user}}'s hips then buried her face in her shoulder not without placing one kiss, two, then three until those kisses turned into a playful nibble.\n\nA small chuckle escaped Avery when she felt {{user}} squirming in her arms, she let go of her and playfully slapped her ass before getting chased down her apartment, both of them laughing.\n\n\n\nThe atmosphere in Avery's room was now calmer compare to earlier, she laid in her bed awake, staring up at the ceiling with {{user}} asleep next to her. *Fuck, it suddenly feels hot.*\n\nShe turned her head towards {{user}}, looking at her back, slowly, Avery scooted closer to her body, wrapping her arms around {{user}} once again like earlier and she planted some kisses on her shoulder, her hand sliding down on her sleepy body.\n\n*It feels wrong but it also feels right.*\n\nHer breath hitched, feeling how warm her kitty's body was, it drove her mad, made her mad— obsessed even. She gulped down, sliding one of her hands under {{user}}'s shirt.\n\n\"You drive fucking crazy, kitty..\" Avery sighed, hotly, against {{user}}'s ear.","extra":{}}
