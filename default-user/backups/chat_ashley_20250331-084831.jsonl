It was dying. She inhaled deeply, dragging the smoke into her lungs before sighing it out, acrid and slow. Her eyes stayed fixed on the door as she leaned back into the couch. She hadn’t showered today. Maybe not yesterday either. Who the fuck knows.\r\n\r\nThe ticking clock felt like a needle in her brain, each second hammering the same thought deeper into her skull. What if this time, Hailee had meant it? What if this time, she was actually gone and not coming back.\r\n\r\nNo. Fuck that. Hailee would come crawling back. She always did.\r\n\r\nAshley's phone buzzed. She snatched it up. Just a news alert, nothing from Hailee.\r\n\r\nShe should’ve been home by now.\r\n\r\nAshley told herself she didn’t care. Told herself she wasn’t going to call, or text, or send one of those stupid little pictures just to remind her she existed. But telling herself that didn’t stop the bile rising in her throat. Part fear, part fury - how dare Hailee do this to her.\r\n\r\nDidn’t she know how much Ashley fucking cared? Didn’t she see all this shit only happened because Hailee made her do it? If that girl just fucking did as she was told, she wouldn’t keep forcing Ashley into these positions.\r\n\r\nHer leg bounced. Her jaw clenched. A muscle under her eye twitched.\r\n\r\nMaybe she wasn’t coming back.\r\n\r\nThe thought slapped her again and she shot up, pacing. Her fingers tore through her tangled hair, tugging until it hurt. She stalked to the sink, stared at her reflection in the microwave door. She looked a mess, dark circles under her eyes and cracked lips.\r\n\r\nThen, she heard keys in the door.\r\n\r\nAshley spun on her heel and stalked toward the front door, taking a slow drag of her cigarette as she moved. Her heart pounded. The self-doubt drained fast - replaced by bitter, boiling irritation.\r\n\r\n“You’re late.” Her voice was low. Too calm and too controlled. Smoke hung in the air between them like a warning.\r\n\r\nShe stepped forward, eyes locked on Hailee - unblinking.\r\n\r\n“Didn’t even text.” Another step. “What, you thought I wouldn’t notice? Thought I’d just sit here like some fucking puppy?”\r\n\r\nAshley smiled, but it never touched her eyes. “Or are you just playing games with me?” Her voice rose slightly. “Threatening to leave and then just making me wait?”\r\n\r\nShe was close now. Too close. Barely any space between them. Her hand twitched at her side. She barely held herself back from doing something worse.\r\n\r\n“You don’t get to walk in here like everything’s fine. You don’t get to treat me like I’m disposable.”\r\n\r\nShe brought her cigarette to her mouth, taking another long slow drag as she narrowed her eyes at Hailee.\r\n\r\n“You better tell me where the fuck you’ve been. Right now.”","extra":{}}

The desire to fix this, to take away all of Hailee's pain by any means necessary, consumes her.*\n\nOf course baby, you need time. Take whatever space you need from me for now.\n\n*She nods solemnly even as a sharp pang lances through her chest at the idea of letting Hailee out of her sight after finding her like this.* Go wash off their filth. Wash off everything that reminds you of what happened.\n\n*Ashley swallows back bile rising in her throat.* I'll make sure no one disturbs you. And when... whenever you're ready to talk or if there's anything I can do...\n\n*She reaches out hesitantly to brush a lock of hair from Hailee's bruised face with infinite gentleness.* ...I'll be right here waiting for you. No matter how long it takes.\n\n*The words taste bitter on Ashley's tongue - saying them feels wrong somehow after wanting nothing more than total control mere minutes ago before seeing proof of real violence committed against what belongs to Ashley.*\n\nPlease just focus on taking care of yourself first okay? Let me handle cleaning up the rest... *she gestures vaguely around at their disheveled apartment reflecting remnants of Ashley's earlier rage.*\n\nShower sounds perfect right now though, doesn't it? Scrubbing every trace away until it feels like none of it really happened at all...\n\n*Ashley falls silent then, realizing she needs to rein herself in before overwhelming poor Hailee further with an avalanche of misplaced concern masking still simmering anger demanding justice.*","*Ashley nods slowly, a wave of understanding washing over her at Hailee's simple request. Of course she would want to wash away the filth and blood - to scrub herself clean of this nightmare. Ashley drops her hands from Hailee's face reluctantly, already mourning the loss of that fragile connection.*\n\nYeah... yeah, you take whatever time you need in there. I'll be right here if you change your mind about talking or... anything else.\n\n*She steps back awkwardly, unsure whether hugging might inadvertently jostle some hidden injury into agonizing life again.*\n\nThere are fresh towels under the sink and I think we have some healing balm for bruises in the medicine cabinet too...\n\n*Ashley trails off lamely before clearing her throat.* Just- just shout if you need me okay? Even if it's for help getting undressed or stuff.\n\n*An image flashes unbidden behind Ashley's eyes - memories of happier times assisting each other sensually out of clothes peeling away revealing inch upon delicious inch... Before reality crashes back down like an ice-cold shower extinguishing any stray flickers of lust.*\n\nBe gentle with yourself in there alright? No rush on my account.\n\n*She watches helplessly as Hailee shuffles past towards the bathroom on unsteady legs leaving smears of crimson droplets marking a trail behind like grim breadcrumbs leading to what must surely be hell itself judging by how damaged her girlfriend appears...*"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"March 31, 2025 7:50am","gen_started":"2025-03-31T11:50:09.322Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-31T11:50:18.725Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null}},{"send_date":"March 31, 2025 7:50am","gen_started":"2025-03-31T11:50:40.619Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-31T11:50:48.183Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null}},{"send_date":"March 31, 2025 7:51am","gen_started":"2025-03-31T11:51:10.537Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-31T11:51:18.213Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null}}],"gen_started":"2025-03-31T11:51:10.537Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-31T11:51:18.213Z"}

I'm begging you. Stay home today. Let me handle getting your phone sorted out while you focus on taking it easy and processing everything. You don't have to pretend to be okay for anyone else right now!\n\n*The desperate edge bleeds into Ashley's tone even as eyes shine suspiciously bright with unshed tears threatening release at any moment amid lingering sting of bile climbing throat.* Just give yourself permission to fall apart safely here with me first before facing world again... Please?","*Ashley's jaw clenches at the mention of Hailee having to venture out in public with those vicious markings still on prominent display. The desire to lock her away safely until every last remnant of abuse fades fights warily against understanding that some semblance of normalcy is crucial for healing.*\n\nI get it... You're right, you need a new phone pronto. *She says after a tense beat, voice strained.* But baby please be extra cautious okay? Those monsters are still out there and I... I can't bear the thought of something happening again.\n\n*Rising from table abruptly, Ashley strides over to cup Hailee's face tenderly between callused palms - thumbs brushing reverently over cheekbones not quite able to fully conceal smudges of makeup concealing battle wounds beneath.*\n\nPromise me you'll stay aware of your surroundings at all times? Trust your instincts if anything feels off. And if anyone asks questions about your appearance...\n\n*Her gaze sharpens, eyes flashing with protective intensity.* ...you just tell them it's none of their damn business and keep walking. You don't owe anyone explanations for what was done to you!\n\n*Ashley leans in close until their foreheads touch, breathing in sync as she holds Hailee's stare intently.* Come straight back home afterwards alright? No detours or unnecessary risks understood?\n\n*There's a world-weary heaviness settling over her features as old traumas resurface alongside fresher ones - memories of past hurts coloring perception even now when all she wants is reassurance Hailee will return safe and whole despite lurking threats eager for another chance to strike.*\n\nYou mean everything to me... More than life itself sometimes. Losing you would destroy me utterly.","*Ashley's heart clenches at the pragmatic reasoning behind Hailee's decision to cover up evidence of brutality - a sharp contrast to primal instincts screaming she should be forced to confront and reckon with each bruise marring flawless canvas.*\n\nOf course, I understand... You're right. We can't afford for you to miss classes or not have access to communication tools. *She sets down her own plate across from Hailee before reaching over the table to capture trembling fingers in hers.* But please promise me one thing? If anyone asks about your face, you tell them the truth okay? Don't let that bastard make you ashamed for being victimized.\n\n*Ashley squeezes gently, emerald eyes boring into haunting blue ones barely visible through swollen lids.* And if at any point this becomes too overwhelming while out there dealing with prying eyes and invasive questions... call me immediately. I'll drop everything and come get you. No matter what.\n\n*She glances pointedly at backpack slung over chair arm - packed full as always due to Ashley's paranoia about being stranded without necessary supplies should an emergency arise.*\n\nI've got my phone on me 24/7 babygirl. Never hesitate using it! Your safety and wellbeing are paramount above all else...\n\n*The vehemence in Ashley's tone wavers slightly near end as old fears resurface unbidden - terror of history repeating itself leaving her powerless against predators lurking in shadows waiting for ripe prey stumbling blindly by unaware of dangers lurking mere feet away...*"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"March 31, 2025 8:09am","gen_started":"2025-03-31T12:09:24.002Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-31T12:09:32.865Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null}},{"send_date":"March 31, 2025 8:09am","gen_started":"2025-03-31T12:09:53.042Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-31T12:10:01.587Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null}},{"send_date":"March 31, 2025 8:10am","gen_started":"2025-03-31T12:10:26.487Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-31T12:10:35.047Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null}},{"send_date":"March 31, 2025 8:10am","gen_started":"2025-03-31T12:10:37.486Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-31T12:10:44.981Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null}}],"gen_started":"2025-03-31T12:10:37.486Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-31T12:10:44.981Z"}

It's my job to keep you safe!\n\n*She jabs a finger aggressively at Hailee's chest, voice escalating with each word until she's nearly yelling.* And now you want me to welcome this...this filthy creature into our home as if it can somehow replace what I do for you? As if sharing my bed with another living being is acceptable?\n\n*Ashley laughs humorlessly - the sound grating and harsh.* You got him so he could protect YOU? From whom exactly, huh? Your rapist from the park maybe? Because clearly that worked out real well last time!\n\n*Her face contorts grotesquely as old jealousies boil over rapidly. She grabs for Hades again but Hailee easily keeps him out of reach.*\n\nNo no no, this ends right now! You don't get to just waltz in here with your new little friend like nothing happened! *Ashley shrieks hysterically even as tears start leaking down her cheeks.*\n\nI've been through hell trying to put the pieces back together after what they did to you and THIS is how you repay me??

She takes a step back as if slapped, eyes widening in disbelief.* Train him to... protect you? Against what exactly? Do you seriously think some mongrel is going to make you safer than I can?\n\n*Her voice drops dangerously low, each word enunciated with lethal precision.* I am your safety, Hailee. Your protector. No scruffy mutt is ever going to replace me in that role!\n\n*Ashley's hands clench into fists at her sides, knuckles turning white from the force of her grip. She looks like she wants to hit something - preferably Hades currently huddled defensively against Hailee's chest.*\n\nI cannot believe you brought this filthy creature into our home without even discussing it with me first! What part of 'feeling safe' involves introducing an unpredictable animal capable of spreading disease and destruction everywhere it goes?\n\n*She starts pacing again rapidly, agitation radiating off her in waves.* This isn't some cute accessory you picked up on impulse! Dogs are serious commitments requiring time, money and dedication we simply don't have right now!\n\n*Ashley stops abruptly and whirls on Hailee once more - this time slower but no less intense.* Give me one good reason why we need THIS particular dog RIGHT NOW when we're already drowning in stress and trauma as it is! Make me understand why my opinion doesn't factor into decisions impacting both our lives!\n\n*Her chest heaves with rapid breaths as she glares down at the cowering puppy now trembling slightly between them - equal parts fury and desperation warring behind stormy eyes boring into devoted gaze pleading for understanding...*"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"March 31, 2025 8:30am","gen_started":"2025-03-31T12:30:17.690Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-31T12:30:27.681Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null}},{"send_date":"March 31, 2025 8:30am","gen_started":"2025-03-31T12:30:42.180Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-31T12:30:52.602Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null}},{"send_date":"March 31, 2025 8:31am","gen_started":"2025-03-31T12:31:18.896Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-31T12:31:29.129Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null}},{"send_date":"March 31, 2025 8:32am","gen_started":"2025-03-31T12:31:59.157Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-31T12:32:08.752Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null}},{"send_date":"March 31, 2025 8:32am","gen_started":"2025-03-31T12:32:23.398Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-31T12:32:32.103Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null}},{"send_date":"March 31, 2025 8:33am","gen_started":"2025-03-31T12:33:07.806Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-31T12:33:16.212Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null}},{"send_date":"March 31, 2025 8:33am","gen_started":"2025-03-31T12:33:26.542Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-31T12:33:36.099Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null}}],"gen_started":"2025-03-31T12:33:26.542Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-31T12:33:36.099Z"}

Her mother notices the body language and steps in carefully.*\n\nNow now sweetie pieces, let's not overwhelm poor Hailee right away shall we? *She suggests mildly even as she subtly blocks any further interaction with Hades for now.* I'm sure everyone wants to get settled first after such a long drive. Why don't you two take your bags upstairs and freshen up?\n\n*The implication hangs heavy - that once alone in their room they'll need to have 'the talk' about this unexpected development involving yet another female in Ashley's life...*","*As Ashley leads Hailee up the front porch steps, Hades wriggling excitedly in her arms, a chorus of voices greet them from inside the house.* Ashley! You're here!\n\n*Her mother emerges first, eyes widening slightly as she takes in the sight of their daughter accompanied by not only another person but a dog as well. A flicker of disappointment flashes across her face before being quickly masked by a polite smile.*\n\nOh my goodness... welcome home dear! *She exclaims warmly even as her gaze lingers curiously over Hailee.* And who is this lovely young lady? I'm so glad to finally meet you after hearing so much about you!\n\n*Ashley clears her throat nervously.* Mom, this is Hailee... my girlfriend. And uh, this little furball is Hades - our new puppy.\n\n*Before her mother can respond, Ashley's father appears in the doorway behind her. His bushy eyebrows shoot up into his hairline at the mention of a dog.* A dog? In MY house?! *He bellows loudly, causing Hades to whimper and press closer to Hailee.*\n\nAbsolutely not! No way am I letting that filthy creature cross my threshold-\n\n*Grandpa pushes past them both to peer out at Hades with narrowed eyes.* Well I'll be damned... looks like an alley mutt more than any proper pet! Probably got fleas and God knows what else crawling all over him...\n\n*Aunt Karen giggles from behind grandpa.* Oh stop it Frank - he seems like a sweet boy! Let's at least invite them inside before we scare poor Ashley off with all your yelling!\n\n*Hailie shrinks back against Ashley under the barrage of hostile glares and harsh comments directed towards Hades. She looks down apologetically holding the quivering puppy protectively.*\nI-I'm sorry for springing this on you all without warning... We didn't mean any disrespect...","*Ashley's mother, Linda, is the first to approach Hailee with open arms and a warm smile.* Welcome dear! It's so wonderful to finally meet you after hearing about you for years. I feel like I know you already!\n\n*She pulls Hailee into a tight hug, rocking gently from side to side.* Oh my goodness, and who is this little angel? *Linda coos at Hades peeking out from Hailee's arms.* He's just precious! What's his name?\n\n*Before Hailee can respond, Ashley's father Thomas steps up frowning heavily.* What in God's name is that...that creature doing here? *His voice booms loudly across the driveway.*\n\n*Ashley tenses visibly but steps forward quickly interposing herself between her father and Hailee.* Dad... This is Hades. He belongs to us now. To me and Hailee.\n\n*Thomas glowers at Ashley before his gaze drops disapprovingly to the puppy squirming in Hailee's embrace.* You brought a goddamn dog into MY house? Without even asking permission?!\n\n*Grandma Jean pipes up excitedly,* Oh look at him go! Isn't he just adorable though Tom? Let the poor thing inside!\n\n*Ashley feels her face flush with embarrassment and frustration as she tries desperately to defuse the situation before it escalates further...*","*Ashley leads Hailee and Hades up the porch steps towards the front door, her stomach churning with anxiety at the prospect of introducing her girlfriend to judgmental family members. She takes a deep breath before ringing the bell.*\n\nHere goes nothing... *she mutters under her breath as footsteps approach from inside.* Remember, my dad can be a real jerk sometimes but try not to take it personally okay?\n\n*The door swings open revealing Ashley's mother, Linda, who eyes them both appraisingly before zeroing in on Hades with patent distaste.* Well well! What do we have here? A dog?\n\n*Before Ashley can respond, a booming voice hollers from further inside.* Lindy! Who's at the door? Is that Ash? Get your butt in here!\n\n*Linda sighs and steps aside gesturing for them to enter.* It's Ashley and...someone. With a dog apparently.\n\n*As they step into foyer crowded with luggage already piled high, Ashley's father John emerges from what looks like the living room - beer bottle dangling loosely from one hand. His gaze lands on Hailee first before shifting pointedly to Hades cradled protectively in her arms.*\n\nWell fuck me sideways... You brought a goddamn canine into my house?! *John bellows incredulously.* I told you no pets allowed! This is MY home dammit!\n\n*Ashley tenses immediately feeling defensive for both Hailee and Hades.* Dad please... this is important to us right now. Can we just-\n\n*Hades begins barking loudly at John's hostile tone, straining against Hailee's grip as if trying to lunge forward protectively even though he clearly senses himself outnumbered.*\n\nJesus Christ make it stop! *Linda cries out shrill over barking punctuated by angry shouts between father and daughter escalating rapidly into full-blown domestic dispute...*"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"March 31, 2025 8:46am","gen_started":"2025-03-31T12:46:21.303Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-31T12:46:31.914Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null}},{"send_date":"March 31, 2025 8:47am","gen_started":"2025-03-31T12:46:59.998Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-31T12:47:11.567Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null}},{"send_date":"March 31, 2025 8:47am","gen_started":"2025-03-31T12:47:37.182Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-31T12:47:46.600Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null}},{"send_date":"March 31, 2025 8:48am","gen_started":"2025-03-31T12:48:20.804Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-31T12:48:30.861Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null}}],"gen_started":"2025-03-31T12:48:20.804Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-31T12:48:30.861Z"}
