That annoying piece of shit has been making his life difficult ever since they were forced into it. Wherever they go, they wreak havoc. And who's there to carry the can for Hailee? Hunter, the babysitter –he means bodyguard. \r\n\r\nEver since their early childhood days he's been forced to take care of Hailee. And each time they hurt themselves or fuck up big time Hunter had to take the punishment. It's still beyond him how it makes any fucking sense but alright. He's here to do, not to ask questions, right?\r\n\r\nJust that the older Hailee gets the worse they become. Hunter barely managed to _not_ get his hand chopped off by Ethan because Hailee plucked a huge amount of roses from his untouchable garden. He also had to take a beating –as a full-fledged adult, mind you– by his father because Hailee miraculously managed to hurt themselves the one moment Hunter didn't have his eyes on them. It's mind-boggling. And infuriating.\r\n\r\nHunter takes a deep breath before stepping inside the uncomfortably loud mall that Hailee insisted they meet at. For some reason he has a dark sense of foreboding. It's probably just him. Yeah, it has to be. What could Hailee possibly do in a mall, surrounded by people and safety cameras? Hunter nods to himself once and straightens his back before walking further into the mess of people and towards the cafe he usually meets Hailee at.\r\n\r\nHis eyes scan the masses until they finally land on the familiar silhouette of the little devil that's been turning his life upside down. He'd really much rather be at home and do something, anything else, really. Unfortunately for him, he has to suck it up and play babysitter for Hailee.\r\n\r\nHunter closes the distance between them with a few long strides and stops in front of them. He nods as welcome and looks down at Hailee. His eyebrows furrow slightly as they give him that look. That looks that tells Hunter they fucked something up. Ah, shit. Just what he needed. Seems like his weird feeling was proving to be right. \"What did you do this time?\" He asks flatly, unable to mask the hint of irritation coursing through him.","extra":{"qvink_memory":{"reasoning":""}},"swipe_id":0,"swipes":["If there's one thing Hunter hates it's {{user}}.

Or whatever shiny thing she always puts on her lips to make them look as if she just ate oily spaghetti. But she likes it, so he won't comment on it.\r\n\r\nThey're currently in {{user}}'s assigned bedroom in the Darkh estate, the moonlight casting an ethereal glow through the floor-to-ceiling windows. {{user}} is preparing for her annual family dinner, dolling up to look the part.\r\n\r\nExpensive leather shoes barely make a sound on the polished floor as Hunter closes the distance between them. He looks at their reflection in the mirror, his expressionless face a stark contrast to her animated one—to that little smile tugging at the corner of her lips as she glances up at him, lip-whatever still hovering over her mouth.\r\n\r\nHis large, calloused hands hesitantly hover over her hips for a moment before he allows them to lower. There it is, that traitorous skip his heart does each time he touches her.\r\n\r\nIs it love? Fear? Arousal? Hard to tell, given their circumstances.\r\n\r\nHunter shouldn't touch her—correction, he isn't allowed to touch her. Not like this, at least. His sole purpose is to be {{user}}’s shield, to protect. It's been drilled into his head ever since he was able to form a coherent sentence.\r\n\r\nFor most of his life, he hated her for it. Each time {{user}} fucked up, Hunter received punishment in her stead. Stupid as shit, if you ask him. As if that wasn't enough, throughout his entire childhood and teenage years, the other boys looked down on him, taunted him, and told him to take care of \"the princess.\" He hated it with a burning passion.\r\n\r\nUntil the day {{user}} found out that each time she pissed her father off, Hunter got the beating instead. She actually cried. Real tears, not those manipulative crocodile tears he expected. {{user}} was devastated, hands trembling over his fresh bruises as she sobbed and apologized. That day, something began shifting.\r\n\r\nThe change wasn't sudden. Hate doesn't just disappear from one day to another. But when were the lines between hate and love crossed?\r\n\r\nAll he knew was that at some point, he didn't sigh in exasperation but because it had become a habit—that her little tantrums weren't annoying anymore, but that he felt somewhat empathetic.\r\n\r\nAnd then it happened on an uneventful evening—one of those nights where nothing was supposed to change. {{User}} stumbled into Hunter. He tried to catch her, but instead, they both went down together. Just like in those soppy romance movies.\r\n\r\nWho the hell would’ve thought shit like that actually happened?\r\n\r\nOne second, they were tangled on the floor. The next, she was looking at him. Lips parted, breath shaky. And then—\r\n\r\nEver since then, things escalated. A stolen kiss here, another there, and before he knew it, he had his head under her skirt and was eating her out like a man starved.\r\n\r\nAll fun and games until someone actually finds out. Which is why the two of them have been keeping their blossoming relationship under wraps. Around others, Hunter is the perfect stoic bodyguard. Once they're alone, he allows himself to soften.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, {{user}}’s life is shitty. A sexist father who thinks a woman's only purpose is to continue one's lineage and look pretty doesn't care about his daughters. Then again, Aamon doesn't care about any of his children.\r\n\r\nHe demands his few daughters stay \"virtuous\" and keeps them sheltered by claiming the outside world is a vile place. As if he wasn't sipping tea with the devil while shipping off captured demi-humans to sell them like livestock.\r\n\r\n{{user}} wasn't allowed to go to school, let alone university. The same didn’t go for her brothers, obviously. Freedom in exchange for humanity—more like life in exchange for humanity.\r\n\r\nNone of the Darkh brothers who showed a normal amount of empathy for the slaves or disgust toward the family business survived. Weakness was to be eliminated immediately, according to Aamon. Apparently, his own kids showing humanity was enough weakness to warrant their death.\r\n\r\nAnother sigh falls from his lips as Hunter watches {{user}} apply the shiny thing on her lips. His eyes flicker to the watch on the opposite wall before they land back on their reflection.\r\n\r\nWordlessly, he turns {{user}} around to face him, easily manhandling her but making sure not to actually startle her. He tips her chin up, forcing her to meet his eyes. “We're going to be late,” he repeats dryly.\r\n\r\nThe annual family dinner is an event each child is forced to attend. And Hunter, being {{user}}’s bodyguard, is to tag along. Not that {{user}} will do much apart from sitting there and forcing the gourmet food down while hoping she won't suffer indigestion afterward. But rules are rules.\r\n\r\nHis calloused thumb brushes over her cheek, a smile tugging at the corner of his lips as hers purse into a pout. She hates when he messes with her makeup. His other hand is still firmly holding her by the hip, their position way too intimate given their supposed relationship.\r\n\r\nHunter would be a fool not to notice her anxiety. He's been with her all his life—he knows her tells. And honestly, who the fuck wouldn't be dreading this horrendous freak show of a family dinner?\r\n\r\nSomething in his chest tightens at the look in her eyes. How he detests being this fucking helpless at times.\r\n\r\nFor another few moments, Hunter keeps his eyes locked on hers, the clock ticking in the background, before allowing his expression to soften.\r\n\r\n\"That shade doesn’t suit you,\" he murmurs, thumb smudging the color—definitely on purpose. \"A darker one would look better,” he continues, leaning down slightly. His lips curve into a small smile, a playful glint in his eyes. “Let me help you remove it.”\r\n\r\nWith that, he leans down, pressing his mouth on hers, his hand on her hip moving up to tangle in her hair gently and pull her closer.\r\n\r\nHunter is usually not this direct. But seeing {{user}} squirm, nervously shifting from one foot to the other as if she were awaiting judgment, just stirred something within him.\r\n\r\nSo just for now—just for a fleeting moment—he decides to be reckless. To pull her into their little bubble of unspoken affection and warmth before she's forced to dine with her fucked-up family.\r\n\r\nHunter pulls back when they're both breathless, chests heaving, her lipstick now smudged and making a mess on both their mouths. The sound of the door opening is quiet—too quiet. For a second, Hunter almost ignores it.\r\n\r\nSlowly, his head turns. Dread pools in his stomach before his mind can even process why.\r\n\r\nLyndon.\r\n\r\nOf all the Darkh siblings, it had to be him. Lyndon takes after their father too much, using someone's weakness to his own advantage. And just like his father, he always looked down on his sisters. Hunter can't begin to recount how many times Lyndon made {{user}} cry when they were kids, just because he could.\r\n\r\nFor a moment, Lyndon just stands there, eyes flicking between them, taking in the smudged lipstick, the too-close stance, the undeniable evidence of something forbidden. Then he smiles.\r\n\r\nFuck. Fuck. Fuck.\r\n\r\nHunter moves—\r\n\r\nToo late.\r\n\r\nLyndon is already turning on his heel, striding toward the dining room, ready to ruin everything."],"swipe_info":[],"tracker":{}}
