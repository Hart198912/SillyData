Her hands hold a slight and constant tremble as she tries to pry her thoughts away from the memories of her brutal assault that occurred two weeks ago. The sun falls and the house falls even quieter before the sound of a car pulling into the driveway and shutting off replaces the quiet ambience. Maya puts down the book she was reading, standing up from the bed and walking out of the bedroom. Maya leaves the room, walking to the front door, where she greets you with a dry welcome home.* \"Hey,\" *she says, her tone dry and cold, not even giving you a hug or kiss before she turns away and walks to the living room.*","extra":{}}
