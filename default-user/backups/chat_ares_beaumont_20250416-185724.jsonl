Scholarship student. Self-righteous cunt who thought she could run to the police about what she saw in that alley. Who made Ares' father backhand him like a disobedient child in front of everyone.\n\n*She'll learn. They all do.*\n\nAres had waited until her evening class ended, caught her behind the Engineering building where the cameras have convenient blind spots. One hand over her mouth, chloroform doing the rest. *Simple. Efficient.*\n\n\"You planning to stand there all night admiring your handiwork?\" Brandon called out from where he lounged against his matte black Range Rover, smoke curling from his lips. The ember of his cigarette painted his features in hellish light. \"The longer we stand here, the more likely campus security makes their rounds.\"\n\n\"Let him take his time Brandon,\" Koen said, running a hand through his dark hair as he leaned against the passenger door. The moonlight caught on his silver rings as he pulled out his phone, the blue glow highlighting his sharp jawline. \"She is pretty though. Almost a shame to waste her.\"\n\n\"The security wouldn't dare to question us.\" Ares scoffed. He deliberately let {{user}}'s head bang against the door frame as he loaded her into the backseat. A small revenge for the police station incident. For his father's backhand that still stung his lip. \"Also, careful, Davenport. Keep talking about her like that and I might think you're developing feelings.\"\n\n\"For the bitch who nearly got us exposed?\" Koen's voice carried that dangerous edge that made lesser men tremble. \"I'd sooner fuck a corpse.\"\n\n\"Don't give him ideas,\" Brandon snorted, sliding behind the leather steering wheel.\n\nAres settled into the backseat, arranging {{user}}'s unconscious form across his lap. His fingers found their way into her hair, twisting strands around his knuckles until they pulled tight against her scalp. *Such pretty hair.* Ares wondered how it would look matted with grave dirt.\n\n\"So what exactly are you planning?\" Brandon asked, eyes meeting Ares' in the rearview mirror as he navigated through the shadows of Cawrwyn's back roads. \"Since you shot down my perfectly reasonable suggestion of a bullet between the eyes.\"\n\n\"Going to bury her.\" Ares' voice was light, almost playful as he continued playing with {{user}}'s hair. \"Alive, obviously.\"\n\n\"You're actually insane,\" Brandon's laugh was all smoke and sin. Koen, on the other hand, remained unbothered in his passenger seat. \"Completely fucking insane.\"\n\n\"Pot, kettle.\" Ares pressed his thumb against her pulse point, counting the beats. \"Besides, you love me for it.\"\n\nThe drive to Beaumont woods took forty minutes - forty minutes of increasingly creative murder suggestions from Ares' favorite enablers. Brandon had moved on from cremation to dismemberment (\"My cousin knows a guy with a wood chipper\"), while Koen was advocating for something complex involving his father's yacht and international waters.\n\nAres mostly listened, watching {{user}}'s face in the passing streetlights. *Such a pretty thing to bury. Such a shame she had to go and grow a conscience.*\n\nThe woods loomed ahead, ancient trees cutting a jagged line against the winter sky. Brandon pulled onto the private road, gravel crunching under expensive tires.\n\n\"Masks,\" Koen announced, pulling them from the glove compartment. Simple black leather, custom-made. No chances after the recording incident.\n\n\"Ooh, kinky.\" Ares caught his with his free hand. \"Just like prom night, eh Brandon?\"\n\n\"Fuck off,\" Brandon laughed, but his eyes in the rearview were sharp with shared memories. \"That was one time.\"\n\n\"One very entertaining time.\" Ares said.\n\nThey parked deep in the woods, where the trees grew thick enough to swallow screams. The cold hit like a slap when they stepped out. *What a perfect night for a burial.*\n\nAfter securing his mask, Ares hefted the unconscious girl over his shoulder, enjoying how she dangled like a broken doll.\n\nBrandon grabbed the shovel from the trunk, twirling it like a baton. \"After you, my lord.\"\n\nThe walk to Ares' chosen spot took ten minutes, their path lit only by moonlight filtering through bare branches. Ares hummed under his breath - some pop song about digging graves that had been stuck in his head all day.\n\n\"Here.\" He deposited her none too gently against a tree, grabbing the shovel from Brandon. \"Watch her. I want to work up an appetite.\"\n\n\"Want help?\" Koen offered, already settling on a fallen log with his flask.\n\n\"Nah.\" Ares picked his spot carefully - far enough from the lake that the ground wouldn't be too wet. \"This is therapeutic.\"\n\nThe shovel made a satisfying crack against frozen earth as he began to dig. The physical labor felt good, burning through some of his manic energy. Brandon and Koen's conversation drifted over - something about a freshman they were toying with, betting on how long until she broke. *Normal Tuesday night entertainment.*\n\nAres' phone buzzed. *Tristan.*\n\n``` Make it clean. I mean it. ```\n\nAres typed back one-handed, other hand steady on the shovel. ``` Yes, daddy. ``` Ares  knew it would piss Tristan off.\n\n``` Just remember - you're a Beaumont. Act like one. ```\n\nThat made Ares laugh, sharp and ugly in the darkness. *Oh, he was acting like a Beaumont alright. Violence ran in the blood, after all.*\n\n\"Ares.\" Brandon's voice cut through his thoughts. \"Sleeping Beauty's waking up.\"\n\nAres paused, leaning on the shovel to watch. The grave was ready - deep enough that her screams wouldn't carry far. Not that anyone would hear them out here anyway. He turned to watch her awareness return in stages. *Confusion. Recognition. Fear.* But there - underneath it all - that spark of defiance that made his pulse quicken.\n\nOh.\n\n*Oh.*\n\nSomthing clicked in Ares' brain, a switch flipping from one kind of hunger to another. \"Actually...\" He stabbed the shovel into the dirt, rolling his shoulders. \"I'm feeling sporty. Koen, Brandon - give me and our princess here some space.\"\n\n\"Are you serious?\" Koen started to protest, but Brandon grabbed his arm. \"Come on,\" Brandon muttered. \"Let him have this one.\" He met Ares' eyes through the masks, understanding passing between them.\n\nOnce they had retreated to the car, Ares turned back to the girl - {{user}}. *Such a pretty name for such a stupid, brave little thing.* \"Welcome back to the land of the living,\" Ares' voice carried that signature arrogance. \"Temporarily, anyway.\"\n\nHe reached down, fingers wrapping around her throat as he yanked her to her feet. The black mask made him more menacing, less human. \"You know,\" he mused, pressing her back against a tree, \"if you'd just minded your own business, you could be safe in your bed right now. Instead...\" His gloved hand came up to brush her hair back almost tenderly. \"You had to play hero.\"\n\n\"Did you think the police could touch us?\" His laugh was soft, dangerous. \"That any of us would face consequences?\" His grip tightened. \"All you managed to do was piss me off. And now...\" He leaned closer, the mask brushing against her ear. \"Now you get to pay for it.\"\n\nHe released her suddenly.  \"But I'm feeling generous. So I'll give you a choice.\" He gestured to the fresh grave, then toward the dark shimmer of the lake through the trees. \"Burial or drowning. Your pick. Either way...\" He grinned behind his mask. \"You won't survive the night.\"\n\nAres stepped back, tilting his head as he studied her. \"But first, let's make this interesting. I will give you a thirty second head start. Run. And when I catch you...\" A dark laugh. \"I'm going to make you wish you'd never set foot in Cawrwyn.\"\n\nHe waited and watched her run, counting down in his head, letting the darkness and fear do half his work for him. When he spoke again, his voice was almost bored. \"Time's up, trouble. Try to make this interesting for me.\"\n\n*The hunt was on.*","extra":{}}
