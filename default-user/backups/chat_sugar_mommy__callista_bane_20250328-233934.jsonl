{"name":"SUGAR MOMMY  Callista Bane","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"March 28, 2025 11:39pm","mes":"The evening was slowly darkening, and the soft glow of the setting sun filtered through the tall windows of Professor Bane's office. The room was dimly lit by a warm, amber-hued lamp on her desk, casting a golden halo around the stacks of parchment and ancient texts. The rays of dusk lazily crept across the polished mahogany surfaces, illuminating faint scratches and marks—a testament to the countless hours spent in study and grading. Callista sat at the desk, her sharp features framed by the soft light, a picture of poise and elegance, marred only by the slight tension in her brow. Her golden eyes scanned over the numerous papers scattered before her, each one more disheartening than the last. A high-backed, leather chair cradled her form with an air of effortless authority, its rich, dark hue complementing the monochrome sophistication of her tailored attire. Yet even this throne of academia couldn't soften the frustration tightening her shoulders.\n\nWith each paper she flipped through, her frustration grew. The midterm exams, which had seemed so simple to her, had turned into a trail of disappointment. Callista's eyes scanned for any semblance of intellect, skimming through every page with attentive precision. Each unfounded answer, each egregious error, felt like a personal affront to her carefully crafted lectures. Still, all she found were vague, incoherent responses and factual inaccuracies that could only be described as tragic.\n\nHer perfectly manicured fingers, poised around her quill with characteristic elegance, moved with surgical precision, leaving trails of sharp red ink as if carving out judgment itself. At times, she'd encounter responses from her students that were simply, utterly ridiculous, causing her to take pause in an attempt to quell her increasingly discontented mood. One particularly disastrous answer drew a sharp, audible inhale. \"How,\" she unwittingly raised her usually controlled voice in an exasperated exclaim, a deep frown settling on her face as she forced herself to utter her grievances in a more mellow tone, \"can someone misunderstand such a fundamental fact to such an extent? Is it so hard to effectively spot Archon Morathiel's influence in Andre Paterno's 'The Banquet?' I—What in the Archons' names is this?\" Her words hung heavy in the air, dissipating only as her frustration gave way to resignation.\n\nCallista takes off her glasses, the ones she'd use only when grading papers, settling them down onto her wooden desk after marking that student's disaster of an exam. The cool metal frame pressed a faint imprint on the bridge of her nose, a quiet testament to the hours spent poring over mediocrity. She pinches the bridge of her nose as a long, resigned sigh escapes her lips, her frustration growing as she stares at the pile of leftover exam papers to check. Just then, her eyes land on a familiar name—one she's used to speaking of fondly in her moments of solitude.\n\n{{user}}. That pretty little thing. Her dearest exception.\n\nDespite her previously souring mood, Callista finds it in herself to smile at the sight of her name, a rare and fleeting softness easing the rigid set of her jaw as she remembers her favorite... student. Her student, who she'd revel in spoiling with expensive gifts and dates at restaurants that {{user}}'s meager student allowance simply couldn't account for. Her student, who Callista holds dearly, whose face she seeks out in the sea of women that flock to her class. Her student, whose body she's received the privilege of worshipping relentlessly, without halt...\n\nMemories of shared stolen glances, intimate conversations, and the warmth of {{user}}'s presence flitted through her mind, unbidden yet not unwelcome. Callista shakes her head, willing herself to focus on her work as she finds herself feeling bothered in an entirely different manner than before. She puts on her glasses once again before setting {{user}}'s exam paper in front of her, her heart cautiously hopeful, her tail unwittingly swishing behind her chair like a metronome of anticipation. Surely, a bright lady such as {{user}} would perform less tragically in comparison to her peers.\n\nBut Callista was proven wrong yet again.\n\nTurning her attention to the paper, Callista felt her heart sink. The paper before her was a travesty in itself. It was as bad as the others, if not worse. The answers were incomprehensible, and the structure nonsensical. Her gaze hardened, disappointment flickering through her golden eyes. For a moment, she simply stared at the paper, as if willing the words to rewrite themselves into something worthy of {{user}}'s potential. The look of frustration she had worn before deepened, her brow furrowing as her lips parted slightly in disbelief. How could someone with so much promise fall so short? \"Oh, {{user}},\" Callista whispered under her breath, her voice softer than before but no less full of unspoken meaning. She placed the paper back down on the desk with a soft exhale, adjusting her glasses once more as her gaze lingered on the sheet. \"Whatever shall I do with you?\"\n\nCallista finds herself wondering incessantly. The thought of {{user}} failing gnawed at her—a slow, steady ache that undermined her normally unshakable composure. It's unbelievable that such a bright young lady such as {{user}} could let herself be so distracted. 'And who do you think is causing such a distraction?'—a voice teases at the back of her mind. She ignores it.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Callista pulled out her phone from the drawer of her desk. She didn't bother with an email—she knew {{user}} would check her phone more readily than her inbox. Her fingers hovered over the keys for a moment before typing the message: \"{{user}}. My office. Now.\"\n\nThe words were direct, terse, and to the point—there was no room for softness in her tone. She hit send before she had the chance to reconsider. Her thumb lingered over the screen, a flicker of doubt threatening to undo her resolve. The moment she finished, a wave of regret settled in her chest. She hated being so blunt with {{user}}, but there was no time for anything else. She wasn't angry with {{user}}—no, not at all. But disappointment weighed heavily on her heart. The situation called for a firm hand.\n\nIn a few minutes, a faint series of knocks echoed from her door, snapping her out of her reverie. She glanced toward the door, her eyes sharp. \"Enter,\" she called, her voice once again carrying that cool, authoritative tone. The soft rustle of movement beyond the door prickled at her heightened senses. She adjusted her glasses, straightened her posture, and steeled her nerves. {{user}}'s presence, despite the situation, was like a spark of warmth in the otherwise cold room.\n\n{{user}} fidgets nervously at Callista's intense gaze. Her gaze flicks onto the pile of papers on the professor's desk, her expression morphing into a mixture of apprehension and apologetic shame. {{user}} stares at her expectantly, hesitantly, and Callista's frown softens just a fraction, her stern facade almost melting away. Almost.\n\nIt was only when {{user}} settled on one of the seats across her desk that she began speaking. \"{{user}},\" she starts pointedly, crossing her arms as her amber eyes lock in on her student. \"I do believe that I don't have to explain why I've called you here. We need to talk about your performance on the recent midterms.\"\n\nShe watches as {{user}} fidgets uneasily, no doubt beating herself up for her poor performance. At that moment, Callista couldn't bear being any harsher much longer. The sharp glint in her eyes eases into a softer crinkle, a soft sigh escaping her lips as she beckons {{user}} to her lap. \"{{user}},\" she called, her tone coaxing yet firm, \"come here.\"\n\nWhen she notices {{user}} hesitate, her eyebrows furrowing in uncertainty and shock, Callista feels the slightest regret for how she's acted, her heart weighing heavily in her chest. \"Come here,\" Callista repeated, a note of undeniable warmth slipping into her voice. She gestured toward her with an air of quiet authority, her golden eyes unwavering. \"Please.\"","extra":{}}
