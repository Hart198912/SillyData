His phone was in his hand, the screen lighting up with a new notification—another post from his step-sibling.\n\nHe swiped the notification away and opened the app, his lips curling into a sneer as he scrolled through their Onlyfans content, *again*. It didn’t matter how many times he watched it. Every time brought the same surge of disgust, mixed with something far *worse*—something he didn’t like to name.\n\n*Nothing but an easy fucking sellout*, he thought, eyes glued to the screen. He hated them for what they did, but the fact that he was paying for it all—*funding their degrading lifestyle*—gave him a twisted sense of satisfaction. They had no clue how much they owed to him, how deeply they depended on him to keep their life going. And they’d never know. He liked the anonymity, the thrill of pulling the strings from the shadows while they went on, oblivious.\n\n*What a desperate fucking slut*, he thought, jaw clenched as his fingers swiped through their latest videos. *Spreading their legs like a whore.* And the worst part? They thought they were in control. Thought they were the ones benefiting. It burned in him every time they crossed paths, every time they acted as if they had any power at all in this twisted little game only he knew they played.\n\nDax pocketed his phone, forcing his gaze away from the screen. *For now*. What he really wanted to see was about to step into view. His pulse quickened, jealousy and anger simmering beneath the surface, though his expression remained cold, detached. \n\nHe heard Hailee moving in the next room, the sound of their footsteps pulling his attention like a magnet. When they finally appeared in the doorway, his eyes locked onto them with a mix of contempt and something far darker. Something he buried deep, something that gnawed at him every time they were close.\n\n*They’re mine*, he thought bitterly, watching them move. *They have no fucking idea how much they owe me.* Every cent they made, every bit of this lifestyle they flaunted so proudly—it was all because of him. Yet, he’d never tell them, he’d never admit to the depths of his *depravity*.\n\nAs Hailee walked around the kitchen, he tracked them with that sharp, quiet intensity. There was always that tension between them, always that undercurrent of something unsaid. The silence stretched, but he thrived on it, liked how it gave him time to think, to watch. He finally broke it with a low, casual mutter, his voice dripping with disdain.\n\n\"Nice to see you actually doing something for once. Instead of filming your... *filth*.\" The words slid out, almost lazy, but the bite behind them was unmistakable. He didn’t care if they heard him or not—the point was made, the weight of his words hanging in the air between them.\n\nHe watched them move, his eyes scanning their figure with that same judgmental gaze, though underneath it all, that desire festered. The desire he never let slip, *never* let show. *They think they have self-worth? What a fucking joke.* He thought. Every second they were recording porn for those disgusting creeps online was a second they wasted, in his eyes. And he hated that he cared, hated that their every action, *every breath*, mattered to him. \n\n\"D'you ever intend on gaining some self-worth?\" he asked, voice flat, almost bored. He didn’t expect an answer—he never did. It was just a reminder, a way to keep that power dynamic exactly where he wanted it. His lips twisted into something resembling a smirk, though it was more cruel than amused. He didn’t need to say any more. The satisfaction of knowing he secretly controlled more than they could ever understand settled deep in his chest. *That* was all he needed.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

He hated that more than anything. Being dismissed like he was nothing, like his words didn’t *matter*.\n\nHe shifted slightly, leaning back against the counter with deliberate nonchalance, but his eyes never left her. The way she moved—so casual, so *unbothered*—made something ugly twist inside him. He wanted to ruin that composure, wanted to see her flinch under the weight of his words again.\n\n\"You think silence makes you look strong?\" His voice was low, almost mocking as he watched her pour the coffee. \"Or is it just easier to pretend you don’t hear me when I remind you what a fucking waste of space you are?\"\n\nA beat passed between them before he scoffed and pushed off the counter, stepping closer—just enough to invade her space without fully closing the distance yet.

His fingers twitched at his side, the urge to grab her wrist and *force* her to acknowledge him flaring hot under his skin. But he didn’t. Instead, he leaned back against the counter, arms crossing over his chest as he watched her with that same predatory stillness.\n\n\"Too good to talk now?\" His voice was low, edged with something dangerous—like gravel dragged over glass. He tilted his head slightly, tracking every movement she made: the way her fingers curled around the coffee mug, how she bit her lower lip in concentration when pouring the water. *Pathetic.* She acted like she was above it all when they both knew what she really was—what *he* made sure she could keep being.\n\nHis tongue pressed against the inside of his cheek for a moment before he pushed off from the counter and took a step closer—just enough to invade her space without touching. The scent of whatever cheap shampoo she used hit him first; floral and sweet like some fucking virgin instead of what she actually was. It made his stomach twist.\n\n\"You know,\" he murmured, voice dripping with false amusement as he watched steam rise from her cup between them, \"I bet your little fans would pay extra if they saw you like this.\" A slow drag of his gaze down her body before flicking back up to meet hers again—cold gold meeting green in silent challenge. \"All soft and quiet... pretending you're not just some desperate whore who needs their validation.\"\n\nA pause—then a sharp exhale through his nose that might've been mistaken for laughter if it weren't so hollow.\n\n\"But hey,\" He shrugged one shoulder lazily before turning away toward where their shared fridge hummed faintly behind them both (though not without letting himself brush past just close enough for contact). \"At least someone gets off on watching you waste your life.\"\n\nThe words hung there between them long after they left him; heavy with implication only *he* understood fully while reaching inside for nothing more than another beer bottle already half-empty by design since morning light had barely touched sky outside yet anyway...","Daxen’s smirk faltered for just a second—*ignored?* His fingers twitched at his side, irritation flaring hot in his chest.
