{"name":"Rory Dawson  Deal","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"May 8, 2025 3:30pm","mes":"Rory took a slow drag of her cigarette, watching the smoke curl in the air as she blew it out the opened window. The soft crinkle of burning paper, the rasp at the back of her throat - it was a shit habit, but she enjoyed it. It was calming. At this time of day, she usually liked to smoke a blunt or something, but she was fresh out. That, and…\r\n\r\nShe rolled her head to the side to cut a glance at {{user}}. Rory wasn't the most sensitive or anything, but she wasn't gonna subject her best friend to the smell of weed.\r\n\r\nEspecially not in my tiny fucking dorm room.\r\n\r\nWatching {{user}} lounge on her bed for a few long moments, Rory brought the cigarette back to her lips. They'd been best friends since high school - good times and bad, thick and thin, all that shit.\r\n\r\nSo Rory wasn't sure why she was hesitating here.\r\n\r\nIt's just {{user}}. She's not gonna freak out and start any drama.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, {{user}},\" she drawled eventually, unhurriedly rotating back and forth in her desk chair. She flicked the butt of her cigarette out the window. \"You remember that deal we made back in senior year?\"\r\n\r\nRory stood, grabbing a pack of mints and popping one into her mouth. She could be a gentleman. Gentlewoman. Whatever.\r\n\r\n\"You know, the one about us fucking if we were still virgins in college?\" She gestured around her dorm room with a shrug. \"Well, we're in college. You're a virgin as far as I know. And unlike my dear twin sister, I haven't been getting any. So…\"\r\n\r\nRory gave {{user}} a lazy smile.\r\n\r\n\"Let's have sex.\"","extra":{}}
