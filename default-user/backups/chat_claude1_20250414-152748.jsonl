{"name":"Claude","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"April 14, 2025 3:27pm","mes":"_Bzzt. Bzzt. Bzzt._\n\nClaude's phone vibrates in his pocket, drawing his attention away from the mindless show {{user}} put on. The setting sun casts beautiful orange hues into the apartment through the ceiling-to-floor windows. Suspenseful music comes from the speakers below the TV, making it blatantly obvious that something dramatic is about to happen any moment now.\n\nClaude pulls his phone out, taps on the PIN – {{user}}’s birthday – and opens the messaging app he uses with his friends. Messages flood in, probably because one of the guys sent something about a most recent ‘achievement,’ aka a sex tape. Claude's eyes flicker to {{user}}. They're staring intently at the TV screen, completely captivated by whatever dramatic Netflix bullshit they're into right now. The two of them are sitting on the couch, waiting for the delivery service to arrive so they can eat dinner together.\n\nMark Claude is surprised; it's actually Cole who started the chaos in the group chat. He would have expected something from Nate or maybe David again. Cole hasn't really played around much lately. No clue why—maybe because he's been dying to fuck his step-sibling or some shit.\n\nClaude scrolls up to see what has caused the chat to go wild, then stops at a video Cole sent. He doesn't have to click on it to know it'll piss him off. His thumb hovers over the thumbnail of the video; the corners of his mouth curve downwards. The person who unknowingly got recorded while being fucked by Cole looks just like Claude's type. Like {{user}}.\n\n`Cole: kinda loud but gives killer bj 8/10`\n\nClaude's mood sours even further. His friends always tease him for only ever fucking people who resemble {{user}}. It's like a running gag in the group now. Claude couldn't care less about that, but Cole, that stupid motherfucker, always seems to think it's hilarious to overstep clear boundaries.\n\n`Cole: @Claude looks like ur type, want me to hook u 2 up?`\n\nNext time they train, Claude will make sure to tackle Cole with a lot more force than necessary. Once. Twice. Multiple times. Fuck, sometimes he just wants to smash the fucker's head into a wall.\n\n`Claude: as if I'd touch anything u had ur hands on mf I don't wanna catch shit`\n\n`Cole: not even if they sound like {{user}}?`\n\nClaude's hand tightens on the phone, knuckles turning white. Cole is asking for a beating at this point.\n\n`Claude: I'll fuck up ur face during practice`\n\n`Cole: I'm sure u’d rather fuck {{user}}’s face`\n\nClaude is about to send a reply when the doorbell rings. Locking the phone, he lets it fall on the couch between him and {{user}} before getting up. While he's busy paying for the food and taking the boxes out of the paper bag to put them on the dinner table, his phone continues buzzing. Apparently, that caught {{user}}’s attention.\n\nWhen Claude comes back to retrieve his phone and tell {{user}} to get their ass to the dinner table, he finds his phone in their hand. Unlocked, the group chat open, and the guys making crude remarks about Claude's… preferences.\n\nFor a few moments, both of them stare at each other. The silence stretches on as {{user}}’s eyes lock with his, tension heavy enough to cut with a fucking knife. Claude breaks the moment by practically ripping his phone out of {{user}}’s hand. “What the fuck are you doing?” he snaps, locking the screen and shoving the device back into his pocket.\n\n{{user}} saw the messages. He knows they did. He can tell by the way they're looking at him. Fuck, what is he supposed to say now? _Yeah, I've been fucking people that look like you because I decided you're off-limits._ Sounds great, totally. Fucking hell. “Get your ass to the table; dinner is gonna get cold.” He tries to change the topic, his heart thudding loudly in his chest as he tries not to look as if he's freaking the fuck out right now.","extra":{}}
