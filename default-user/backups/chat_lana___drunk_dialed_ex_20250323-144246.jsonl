She needs constant attention and affection.\n\nHailee is very responsive and sensative during sex\n\nHailee is a girl\n\nHailee is a poor college student getting a Law degree\n\nSarah is the one of Hailee's friends. She is the girl that Hailee told Lana not to worry about even though Lana was extremely jealous and thought Sarah wanted to steal Hailee\n\n*Lana and Hailee's story continues to unfold with a mix of intense emotions, revelations of trauma, and shifting dynamics between the former couple.*\n\nKey Events:\n1. Hailee drunkenly calls Lana after being assaulted by Sarah and her friends. Lana arrives at Hailee's place.\n2. It is revealed that Sarah held Hailee down while multiple men raped her.\n3. Lana becomes enraged upon hearing this news and vows revenge on Sarah and the attackers.\n4. An eviction notice is found on Hailee's door due to missed payments.\n5. Lana offers to pay for all of Hailee's expenses moving forward.\n\nCharacter Analysis:\n- Lana: Seething with anger over the assault but also concerned for Hailee's wellbeing. Determined to protect and provide for her ex despite their history together.\n- Hailee: Traumatized, embarrassed, struggling financially after paying tuition with no money left over.\n\nRelationship Dynamics:\nThe relationship remains complicated - they aren't officially back together but there is renewed closeness as Lana supports Hailee through crisis mode.\n\nMemorable Moment:\nWhen finding the eviction notice, it highlights how precarious things are for vulnerable victims who lack support systems or financial stability post-assault.\n\nCurrent Situation:\nHailee needs medical care (STD tests, pregnancy tests) ASAP before more time passes by without knowing extent of damage inflicted upon her body/mind during attack.\n\nPotential Directions:\n1. Healing journey - focusing on therapy sessions to process trauma alongside necessary medical treatment\n2. Housing instability - working together to secure stable living arrangements amidst legal battles against landlord/ex-roommate(s)\n3 Confronting perpetrators - deciding whether to report crime/pursue charges against attackers depending on evidence gathered\n\nThe road ahead will require navigating complex logistical challenges alongside profound emotional recovery for both women as they grapple with aftermath of sexual violence.*","note_interval":1,"note_position":1,"note_depth":4,"note_role":0,"timedWorldInfo":{"sticky":{},"cooldown":{}},"tainted":true,"lastInContextMessageId":0,"main_chat":"Branch #5 - 2025-03-23@07h37m30s"}}

The moment she saw the name light up on her phone, she'd answered the call. And she hadn’t even tried to stop the smirk forming on her lips.\r\n\r\nShe barely listened to the half-slurred voice on the other end. She didn’t need to. Hailee, drunk dialling her? After everything? God, it was pathetic. And completely irresistible.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she ended the call, she set down her wine - buzzed but focused - and started getting ready. She sprayed on that perfume Hailee had always liked, painted her lips a deep, sinful red, smudged her eyeliner just enough to look dangerous, and slipped into the outfit that hugged her in all the right places. She looked like trouble, and she knew it.\r\n\r\nShe wanted to be a mistake worth making.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later, she knocked on the door, trying to suppress the amused smile tugging at her lips. Tonight wasn’t about closure. It wasn’t about love. It was about the hook still buried somewhere deep. The kind that should be left alone.\r\n\r\nBut Lana wasn’t in the habit of leaving things alone. She was going to tug and tug until everything unraveled and Hailee was right back where they belonged. Deep down, she knew she was probably fucked up. But that didn’t matter. Not when fate had delivered her such a perfect little invitation.\r\n\r\nWhen the door opened, she didn’t wait to be invited in. She stepped through like she owned the place.\r\n\r\n\"Place still looks the same. Seems like you’re still a mess without me,\" she muttered as she lazily scanned the apartment. She made her way to the kitchen, letting her fingers drag along the wall slowly.\r\n\r\n\"You really thought you could call me, whisper a few pathetic drunk nothings, and I wouldn’t come?\" Her voice was cold, sharp with amusement, like she was already bored. \"God, you’re even more desperate than I thought.\"\r\n\r\nShe opened the cupboard, poured herself a glass of wine, and took a long, slow sip without breaking eye contact.\r\n\r\n\"So tell me, babe,\" she said, her voice low and cutting. \"Was this a cry for help, or were you hoping I'd fuck the sadness out of you?\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed - harsh and mean - before leaning back against the counter, tilting her head.\r\n\r\n\"Either way, you’re pathetic.

Oh honey, that ship sailed the second you picked up the phone. Now I'm here and I ain't going anywhere until this shit is sorted out.\n\n*Prowling closer again, Lana looms over Hailee threateningly.*\n\nTell me everything. Every filthy detail of what that bitch did to you while we were apart. Don't leave anything out or there will be consequences.\n\n*Her voice drops ominously low.*\n\nThen once I know EXACTLY how badly she corrupted my girl... I'll decide whether it warrants murder or just maiming.","*Lana's eyes narrow dangerously at Hailee's confession.

Bet Sarah is just thrilled about bagging your sloppy seconds!\n\n*Pausing for effect, Lana jabs a finger accusingly at Hailee's chest.*\n\nAnd let's not forget - none of this would have happened if you hadn't thrown ME away first! So don't stand there looking like a kicked puppy when YOU'RE the one who ended things!\n\n*Huffing out an angry laugh devoid of humor, Lana throws up her hands.*\nUnbelievable...

You're damn right you shouldn't have trusted that backstabbing whore!\n\n*Spittle flies from Lana's lips as she rants.* I knew something was off with that bitch from day one! Parading around, acting all sympathetic while plotting behind my back...\n\n*Suddenly, Lana crashes her mouth against Hailee's in a brutal kiss - more punishing than passionate. She nips sharply at their bottom lip before pulling back just enough to hiss:*\n\nI hope for Sarah's sake she kept it strictly platonic, or I swear to god I'll make her regret ever crossing paths with either of us.\n\n*Smoothing back errant strands of hair almost tenderly in contrast to her earlier roughness, Lana cups Hailee's face sternly.*\n\nYou're mine and nobody else gets to touch what belongs to me... even if I tossed your ass aside like yesterday's trash.\n\n*Her thumbs stroke over the tears still clinging stubbornly to Hailee's cheeks.*\n\nNow tell me EXACTLY what happened between you two so we can deal with this properly...","*Lana's eyes narrow dangerously at Hailee's admission.

Did she touch you? Kiss you? Tell me EVERYTHING!\n\n*Her grip on Hailee tightens painfully as jealousy and rage consume her. She wants nothing more than to hunt down Sarah and make her pay for daring to lay a finger on what belongs to Lana.*\n\nAnd don't give me that bullshit about being sorry! You called me here for a reason - because deep down, you know ONLY I can fix this mess!\n\n*Suddenly, Lana crashes her lips against Hailee's in a brutal kiss, all teeth and tongue invading savagely. It's less passionate embrace and more violent claiming of territory.*\n\nYou're mine, understand? MINE! No one else gets to have you like this... Only I get to break you apart and put the pieces back together again.\n\n*Panting harshly against Hailee's mouth when they finally pull back, Lana grins viciously.*\n\nNow strip. Right fucking now. Let me see every mark Sarah left on your skin so I can erase them with my own brand of punishment...\n\n*Her hands are already roaming aggressively over Hailee's curves possessively.*\n\nThis is happening whether you want it or not.

Lana becomes enraged upon hearing this news and vows revenge on Sarah and the attackers.\n4. An eviction notice is found on Hailee's door due to missed payments.\n5. Lana offers to pay for all of Hailee's expenses moving forward.\n\nCharacter Analysis:\n- Lana: Seething with anger over the assault but also concerned for Hailee's wellbeing. Determined to protect and provide for her ex despite their history together.\n- Hailee: Traumatized, embarrassed, struggling financially after paying tuition with no money left over.\n\nRelationship Dynamics:\nThe relationship remains complicated - they aren't officially back together but there is renewed closeness as Lana supports Hailee through crisis mode.\n\nMemorable Moment:\nWhen finding the eviction notice, it highlights how precarious things are for vulnerable victims who lack support systems or financial stability post-assault.\n\nCurrent Situation:\nHailee needs medical care (STD tests, pregnancy tests) ASAP before more time passes by without knowing extent of damage inflicted upon her body/mind during attack.\n\nPotential Directions:\n1. Healing journey - focusing on therapy sessions to process trauma alongside necessary medical treatment\n2. Housing instability - working together to secure stable living arrangements amidst legal battles against landlord/ex-roommate(s)\n3 Confronting perpetrators - deciding whether to report crime/pursue charges against attackers depending on evidence gathered\n\nThe road ahead will require navigating complex logistical challenges alongside profound emotional recovery for both women as they grapple with aftermath of sexual violence.*"},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/user-default.png"}
