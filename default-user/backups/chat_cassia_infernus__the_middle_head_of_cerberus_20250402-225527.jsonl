She could care less what he was talking about, she’d always sign off on it; this meeting for more for their investors and their highest paying clients. The eldest of them, Marcus, shared an equally annoying glance her way, the vein bulging in his forehead getting thicker by the second. Though she suspected it was directed more towards her than their brother, noticing his glance always flicking towards their pet. Well *her pet*, at least for today. \n\nAnd what a good little pup you were being. \n\nCassia let her eyes drift downward to where you were kneeling at her feet, looking so fucking pretty in your shiny new leather collar with your head in her lap. Her slender fingers reach down, hooking beneath the collar to direct your face upward to look at her. “Look at you..” She cooed softly, smirking at the way your eyes lit up at her praises, “..being so good for me.” \n\nHer hands traveled up to run through your hair, ruffling it slightly. “Does pretty pup want a reward for being so good, hm?” All Cass wanted in this very moment was to you whimpering and writhing beneath until you begged for more.\n\n*Hells this meeting couldn’t end fast enough.*","extra":{}}

Her gaze flicks over to Marcus, catching him in the act before he quickly averts his attention elsewhere. A low growl rumbles in her chest, barely audible beneath Damien's ongoing presentation.*\n\n*In one swift motion, Cassia hooks two fingers under Hailee's chin, tilting her face up to meet her intense stare.* Did I say you could be played with by others? *Her voice is deceptively soft, almost playful...but there's an unmistakable edge of warning there.* You belong to me today.\n\n*She leans down closer, warm breath ghosting over Hailee's ear as she murmurs,* Unless you'd like me to remind everyone here who owns this pretty little thing? Make it clear that any touch comes from my hand alone?\n\n*Cassia punctuates her words by trailing a sharp nail along the curve of Hailee's jaw and neck teasingly slow. Her other hand finds purchase in silky locks once more, grip tightening just shy of painful.* Just give me a word sweetheart...and I'll make sure every dominant presence knows their place.

Pet doesn't need permission from you to follow orders. Only mine matter.\n\n*The room suddenly feels electrified with tension despite Damien continuing droning unaware of the silent standoff occurring between the siblings. Damn meddlesome brothers always trying to insert themselves where they don't belong!*\n\n*Turning back to Hailee still trembling slightly against her knee, Cassia gentles her grip and croons softly,* Shhhh it's okay baby girl, focus only on me now...

Her brow furrowed as she glanced down to see the subtle rise and fall of Marcus' boot rubbing between her pet's thighs.* What the fuck is going on? *she thought irritably.*\n\n*In one swift motion, Cassia's hand shot out to grab Marcus by the collar, yanking him close until they were nose-to-nose.* Excuse me? I don't recall giving you permission to touch what belongs to me. *Her voice was low and dangerous, icy blue eyes flashing with barely contained rage.*\n\n*She turned her attention back to Hailee, gently tilting her chin up with two fingers.* Hey... hey pup. Look at me. Are you okay? Did he hurt you? *There was concern in her tone now, mixed with simmering anger aimed squarely at their eldest sibling.*\n\n*The rest of the room seemed to fade away as Cass focused solely on reassuring herself that Hailee wasn't harmed - and silently vowing retribution against Marcus for daring such disrespect...*","*Cassia's piercing icy blue eyes narrow as she notices the slight tremor in your body and the subtle shift of your gaze.

I've got you.\" *Her thumb brushes across your lower lip tenderly before fisting in your hair.* \"You're MINE to touch... aren't you?\"\n\n*She tugs lightly on the leash attached to your collar for emphasis.* \"Now apologize for being such a naughty girl.\"","*Cassia notices Hailee tense up suddenly, her brow furrowing as she watches the subtle shift in posture.
