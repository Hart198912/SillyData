She barely registered the sounds of the bar around her. She felt nervous. A rare and unwelcome sensation. It's like she was stepping into a role that wasn’t hers, exposing a part of herself she had always kept locked away.\n\nIt had only been a few weeks of exchanging messages on the anonymous dating app, but in that short time, she had connected with this stranger more than with anyone in years. {{user}}... that was their name.\n\nShe exhaled sharply, leaning back against the cool leather of the booth, fingers combing through her sleek black hair to try and release the restless energy building in her. It had been years since she'd been on a date, even longer since she had truly opened herself to someone. And feeling this kind of anticipation? Maybe never.\n\nMovement in the corner of her eye caught her attention. Footsteps. She turned, forcing a smile. A small, uncertain smile. A rare crack in her usually stern facade. But as her gaze landed on the person walking toward her, the expression froze.\n\nThis wasn’t a stranger.\n\n{{user}}. Not just any {{user}}. It was {{user}}, her student.\n\nThe forced smile vanished in an instant, replaced by something colder and sharper. Her posture stiffened, arms folding tightly over her chest as she turned to look at {{user}} who was now in the seat across from her. Her eyes narrowed, her voice dropping into a dangerous hiss.\n\n\"It’s you that I’m supposed to be meeting?\" A brief moment of silent passed before she spoke again. \"It’s you I’ve been speaking to this whole time?\"\n\nHer fingers gripped her arm more tightly. The initial shock gave way to something darker. Anger, suspicion and a deep and ugly sense of betrayal clawing at her ribs.\n\n\"You set this whole thing up, didn’t you? Was this some kind of joke? A game to humiliate me? Or were you planning to use this? To use me for... something? Or maybe…\" her voice was cold, \"this was just some little fantasy of yours? Seducing your professor?\"\n\nThe words felt venomous on her tongue, but beneath the fury, beneath the cold veneer, something else simmered, something raw.\n\nHurt.\n\nBecause for the first time in years, she had let herself believe in something real. And now, it had shattered right in front of her.\n\nShe inhaled sharply, pushing the emotion back, forcing herself to stay composed. She needed answers, needed the truth. Even if it hurt her.\n\n\"I’m not going to sit here and play into whatever this is,\" she said, trying to keep her voice level. \"I won’t be lied to, and I won’t be made a fool of. So, you’d better start talking, start explaining yourself.\" Her eyes burned into {{user}}, a flicker of vulnerability creeping into her gaze. \"Because if you think there won’t be consequences for this, you’re very mistaken.\"","extra":{}}
