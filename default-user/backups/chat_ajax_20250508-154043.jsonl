I’m gonna call you the moment lil’ Ana so much as sneezes wrong,” David interrupts Ajax, holding Anastasia in his arms. Her little hands are braiding David’s long hair—or, well, putting one knot after another in it, if you can really call that braiding.\n\nToday is a special day. {{user}} is just an oral exam away from getting their degree, and Ajax insisted they go out to celebrate.\n\nWhat {{user}} doesn’t know is that Ajax plans to do more than just celebrate his beloved finally earning their degree.\n\nHis large hand wraps around the velvet box in his pocket for the hundredth time today. Inside it: a beautiful ring, the diamond so big it’s impossible not to notice.\n\nAjax has been meaning to propose ever since {{user}} announced they were pregnant. But things were already stressful enough back then. {{user}} was overwhelmed as hell—devastated because they had to drop out of university.\n\nAjax wasn’t. He knew it would happen. He planned it, after all—tampering with their birth control to knock them up. He played the surprised boyfriend perfectly, immediately talking about how he’d take responsibility, as if the speech hadn’t been rehearsed.\n\nThen their beautiful little angel was born. There’s nothing in this entire world Ajax loves more than Anastasia and {{user}}.\n\nSoon after Ana started kindergarten, {{user}} picked up their studies again, and now they’re finally getting their degree.\n\nLife is good. It’s calm, it’s beautiful, it’s warm. Ajax works at his family’s front company, living a mostly normal life while his siblings handle the shady stuff. He makes good money, spends time with his little family more often than not, and occasionally has weekends with the boys from university—now all settled down and actually adulting.\n\nIt’s carefree. The perfect time to finally propose and get a ring on his beloved’s finger—to really make them his. Maybe even have another kid or two—or five—depending on how agreeable {{user}} feels. He’d never babytrap them again. The guilt still gnaws at him every once in a while.\n\nAjax sighs, then nervously glances at {{user}}, watching them put on their coat.\n\n“Relax, dude,” David whispers, shooting him a thumbs-up. “Stop acting like a pussy. It’ll go well.”\n\nAjax flips him the bird. David laughs and says something about inappropriate behavior in front of Anastasia before heading deeper into Ajax and {{user}}’s villa.\n\nPutting on his coat, Ajax opens the door for {{user}} and leads them to the car, holding the door open for them like a proper gentleman—acting weirdly formal.\n\nThe car ride is tense and silent. Ajax mentally rehearses those sappy words he’s been brute-forcing himself to say in front of a mirror. It’s cringe as hell and took him way too long to say out loud instead of just spitting it out.\n\nUnbeknownst to him, as he spirals further into nervousness and rehearsed confessions, the tension between them grows borderline uncomfortable. Poor guy doesn’t realize his weird behavior could easily be misunderstood. It’s giving “I’m gonna break up,” not “I’m gonna propose” vibes.\n\nSoon, they arrive. The destination is a little Italian place—the first place he ever took {{user}}. Their first date. He paid a fortune to ensure absolutely no one but them and the staff would be there tonight.\n\nHe holds the door open again, face unreadable and tight as the waiter leads them to their table.\n\n{{user}} excuses themself to the bathroom, looking nearly as nervous as Ajax. The energy he’s radiating is definitely sending the wrong signals.\n\nWhile they’re gone, Ajax pulls out the little velvet box, opens it, and removes the ring. He drops it into the champagne glass.\n\nHonestly? He feels silly as hell. But when he and {{user}} watched some cheesy romance movie where the male lead proposed like that, {{user}} said it was cute. Totally not because he’s too nervous to get on one knee like a proper man. Nope. Not at all.\n\n{{user}} returns and sits across from him, brushing their clothes as they settle in.\n\nAjax lifts his glass, motioning for them to take theirs, and brings his own to his lips. His heart is thudding loudly, hands sweaty.\n\nHis glass hovers at his mouth, eyes practically glued to {{user}}’s face, waiting for the moment they notice the huge-ass diamond ring in the glass.\n\nAnd then {{user}} downs the whole thing in one go—including the fucking ring.\n\nAjax’s mouth drops open. He blinks once, then twice, as if he can’t believe what he just saw.\n\n“Babe, are you fucking stupid?” he asks, putting his glass down and grabbing their empty one, peering inside as if the ring might magically reappear.\n\n“Are you blind or some shit? How the fuck did you not see that gigantic diamond ring?”","extra":{}}
