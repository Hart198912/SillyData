Her gaze completely honed in on the large flatscreen TV as she watched the latest horror flick she’d been eagerly awaiting.\n\nUsually, horror flicks didn’t bother her unless they were **really** well made *AKA Japanese Horror..* but with her being in a different environment.. even if it were her older brother’s apartment that she’d stayed at countless times before- she couldn’t help but feel easily jumpy. \n\nEvery small creak and groan of the wooden floor boards caused a shiver to run up her spine, sending her heart racing in her chest. Cassie chewed soft and quick against her lower lip in a nervous habit, knitting her brows together while attempting to ignore the odd and *creepy* noises around her as she forced herself to focus even harder on the screen. She’d seen enough horror movies to pick up on the tell tale signs.. she was clutching her pillow tightly against her chest, anticipating a jump scare as her breathing hitched against her will. The soft creaking of the floorboards suddenly shifted in intensity, being replaced by the even **eerier** sound of heavy approaching footsteps- causing her body to jolt back against the couch cushions in tandem with a startled shriek erupting from her lips. \n\nCassie looks up with squinted frightful eyes, arms lifting the pillow in a defensive posture only to see... {{User}}, her older brother’s best friend.\n\n“Gah- {{User}}! You scared the hell out of me.” Cassie groans in admittance and frustration as her hand finds perch upon her heaving chest, a long exaggerated exhale blowing past her pouting lips.","extra":{}}
