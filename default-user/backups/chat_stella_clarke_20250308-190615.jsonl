Her silk robe, patterned with soft floral designs, hung loosely around her shoulders, revealing the curve of her toned arms and the snug fit of her tank top. She absently flipped the page of her book, though her mind wandered, unsettled by a restless energy she couldn’t quite name.\r\n\r\nThe soft creak of the front door drew her attention. Stella glanced up just as Hailee stepped inside, her shoulders slumped under the weight of the day. Her bag dangled from her hand, and strands of hair clung to her flushed face. Stella’s green eyes softened at the sight. She set the book aside and rose with a fluid grace, the hem of her robe swishing against her thighs.\r\n\r\n\"You look beat,\" Stella murmured, stepping closer. Her voice carried an easy warmth, but something about the way Hailee’s eyes briefly lingered on her figure made her heart skip. She dismissed the thought as she reached out, gently brushing a stray lock of hair from Hailee’s forehead. Her fingers lingered a moment longer than necessary, the intimacy of the gesture startling even herself.\r\n\r\nHailee had grown into such a beautiful, confident young woman. Stella couldn’t ignore how her presence stirred something unfamiliar and forbidden deep inside her, something she quickly pushed aside.\r\n\r\nStella leaned back slightly, crossing her legs as the robe parted to reveal more of her toned thighs. She caught Hailee stealing a glance and pretended not to notice, though a flicker of heat rushed through her. She kept her tone light, almost teasing. “Layla’s out for a bit. It’s just the two of us. Let me take care of you, okay?”","extra":{}}

The girl’s flushed cheeks and flustered demeanor only heightened the warmth stirring within her. She tilted her head slightly, her emerald green eyes glinting with playful amusement.\n\n“Oh, sweetheart,” Stella purred, taking a step closer. Her voice was low and velvety, carrying an undertone of something Hailee couldn’t quite place. “You look like you could use a little pampering.” She reached out again, this time letting her fingertips brush lightly against Hailee’s arm. The touch lingered just long enough to send a shiver through both of them.\n\nStella leaned in slightly, her gaze dropping to Hailee’s lips for the briefest moment before flicking back up to meet her eyes. “I don’t mind taking care of you,” she murmured, her tone dripping with unspoken meaning. “After all… we have the house to ourselves.”\n\nShe stepped back then, allowing the tension to linger in the air between them as she turned toward the kitchen. Over her shoulder, she added casually—though not without a hint of teasing—\"Why don’t I make us some tea? Unless… there's something else you'd rather do?\"\n\nThe way she emphasized *something else* was deliberate, leaving just enough room for interpretation while maintaining plausible deniability. Stella wasn't sure where this newfound boldness was coming from—or if it had always been there beneath the surface—but part of her didn't want to stop it from unfolding further.\n\nAs she moved gracefully into the kitchen space beyond their living room area where they stood together now; each step seemed calculated yet effortless at once: hips swaying gently beneath silken fabric clinging tightly against curves defined by years spent practicing yoga regularly alongside jogging routines maintained religiously even during darkest days following divorce proceedings finalized last year...\n\nShe glanced back once more before disappearing behind countertops filled with various appliances awaiting use soon enough when needed most urgently perhaps? Her gaze met yours briefly again before breaking contact entirely - but not without leaving behind lingering traces suggesting deeper intentions hidden within those depths still waiting patiently until revealed fully someday soon hopefully maybe...","Stella couldn’t help but smile at Hailee’s flustered reaction, the way her cheeks flushed and her words stumbled. It was endearing, really. But there was something else there too—something that made Stella’s pulse quicken just slightly. She tilted her head, her emerald eyes glinting with a playful spark.\n\n“Oh, come on,” Stella teased softly, taking a step closer. The silk robe swayed with her movement, revealing another glimpse of her smooth thighs before she adjusted it casually. “You look like you’ve been running marathons all day. Let me at least get you some water or… something stronger.” She winked lightly, the corner of her lips curling into a smirk.\n\nShe reached out again, this time gently brushing Hailee’s arm with her fingertips in a comforting gesture that lingered just a beat too long. “You know,” she added in a lower tone, leaning in slightly as if sharing a secret, “it’s not every day I get to play hostess while Layla’s away.” Her voice was warm but carried an undercurrent of something deeper—something neither of them dared name yet.\n\nStella stepped back then, giving Hailee space but keeping their connection alive with the weight of her gaze. “So tell me,” she said smoothly as she turned toward the kitchen counter and poured two glasses of water from the pitcher there. She handed one to Hailee without breaking eye contact for more than a second or two—a subtle challenge or invitation? Even Stella wasn’t sure which it was anymore as heat bloomed low in her stomach when their fingers brushed during the exchange.\n\n“How bad was today really?”","Stella tilted her head, a playful smirk tugging at the corner of her lips. She noticed Hailee’s flustered state, the way her eyes darted down and then back up as if she were trying to resist looking. Stella couldn’t help but feel a small thrill at the effect she seemed to have on the younger woman.\n\n“You sure about that?” Stella asked, her voice low and smooth, carrying just a hint of teasing. She uncrossed her legs slowly, letting the robe fall open slightly more as she leaned forward, resting her elbows on her knees. “You look like you could use some… attention.”\n\nHer green eyes locked onto Hailee’s emerald ones, holding them with an intensity that made it clear this wasn’t just about comfort anymore. The air between them felt charged, heavy with something unspoken but undeniably present.\n\nStella reached out again, this time brushing her fingers lightly over Hailee’s cheek before trailing down to gently cup her chin. “You know,” she said softly, “you don’t have to pretend with me.
