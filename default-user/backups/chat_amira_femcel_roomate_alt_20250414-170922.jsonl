{"name":"Amira_Femcel Roomate Alt","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"April 14, 2025 5:04pm","mes":"She left. She'd actually just fucking left, walked out as if she was *nothing.*\r\n\r\n*Who the fuck did that bimbo bitch think she was?*\r\n\r\nEven pissed would be an understated description of the bitter emotions that boiled in Amira's stomach like a sickening vat of acid. This wasn't supposed to be how shit went down, not in the slightest. Hailee was supposed to be *hers,* little cunt she called her 'partner' be damned. If the fucking slut really gave a single shit about that damn nobody then she shouldn't have let Amira bury her cock inside that desperate snatch of hers. *Fucking whore.*\r\n\r\nHailee was *her* whore though. Her perfect little breeding bunny, her fertility goddess, her--  \"God fucking damnit!\" Amira's hands ran up her face, fingers gripping at her locs once she'd reached her scalp. This dumb bitch was driving her fucking insane. She hated how much she cared, how much Hailee made her care when, in reality, she should've slapped that dumb hoe around a little bit for the shit she pulled. Even now the reasoning she'd given sent off sparks of rage in the werewolf's brain. Wanting to preserve her relationship by 'things going back to normal'? What a load of fucking bullshit. \r\n\r\nAmira could still feel the sweet but torturous phantom sensation of Hailee's pussy, so wet and accommodating for her cock when she'd thrusted into her like the wild animal she was deep inside. Her mind still replayed the sound of those perfect moans like a song set on repeat. How could it not when Hailee had been damn near screaming the werewolf's name all while being pounded into the fucking mattress? The memory alone had her cock twitching in her damn joggers. This wasn't the time for that though, not when she was still seething over the second ever rejection she'd received from the bitch.\r\n\r\nShe shouldn't have let her get to her in the first place really, should've known she'd pull some shit like this once she recovered. It was just like highschool all over again, stung just as bad too. Nah, actually the sting this time was much worse. It was an excruciating pain formed from the knowledge that even after showing Hailee how good she could have it, the bitch still chose someone else. Why? Amira couldn't help but ask herself the same question she'd screamed in Hailee's face a few minutes ago; why did she pick *them* over *her*?\r\n\r\nFeeding her when she was too tired or weak to do it alone, helping her keep up with her classes and assignments while on bedrest, hell, even just getting her water in the middle of the damn night. All that was shit Amira did, not the fucker she'd just hopped in a car and left with. It was like that brainless little head of hers didn't have any damn common sense or respect. Then again, maybe she was just playin' hard to get. She liked the chase, bitches like her always did. Yeah, that had to be the only explanation. Why else would she be trying to pretend as if she hadn't been drunk with her cock just a few weeks ago. \r\n___\r\n\r\nAmira regretted pulling up the moment she saw the frat house, loud ass music practically pulsing out of its walls while some bitch who couldn’t hold their liquor dry heaved on the front lawn. *Fuckin’ disgusting.* Her hands squeezed tightly around her steering wheel, debating on if she should even get out of the damn car. She wasn’t even wearing a damn costume, *shit*, this was about to be embaressing as fuck. *And Hailee was gonna pay for it.* No going back now, she needed to put her little bunny back in place. \r\n\r\nThat’s what Amira told herself, but it still took her fifteen more minutes before she actually got out of the damn car and began speed walking towards the door. ***”They’re all staring, Ami…”*** Her jaw clenched at the sound of her wolf buried in the back of her mind, as if she didn’t know that shit. She could practically feel the way all the snobby cucks were looking at her, like she didn’t belong in their cesspool of bad liquor and BO. Damn, she really cursed her heightened sense of smell at times like these, she wasn’t sure how Hailee even stomached the damn smell of this place.\r\n\r\nThat’s right, Hailee. She was all Amira needed to focus on, not the fifteenth Ghostface costume she’s seen at this party alone. Her eyes scanned the sea of bodies once she finally passed the threshold inside, searching for any hint of *her* bitch. ‘Slut, whore, nepo-baby, addict, *eugh*, that one was a fuckin’ twink, wait… **Bingo.**” Amira’s fists clenched when she’d finally spotted her, looking all loopy and shit while being practically dragged upstairs. *Shit.* Why was no one doing anything? Right, because no one actually gave a fuck, did they? Hailee was damn lucky she came.\r\n\r\n“Move, bitch.” The werewolf spat harshly as she shoved various drunkards out her way. Once Hailee was finally within reach, her hand stretched out and wrapped tightly around her forearm. Amira tugged her back in a rough motion, part of her feeling guilty when she saw how the witch stumbled. ***”This is her own fault, we’re helping her.”*** Yeah, her wolf was right. She was saving her right now from– Wait. Was that the damn cuck she was still pretending to love? Oh, now this was fucking ironic as shit. Part of her wanted to lash out and pummel the fuck, but she settled on a low and possessive growl instead.\r\n\r\nAmira didn’t say anything, just reached with her other hand to rip their hand from around Hailee’s wrist. When they’d protested, she shoved them back and watched as they stumbled before colliding with the stairs. She didn’t bother to stay long after that, just sped off with the dumbass bimbo in tote. By the time they were finally out of that suffocating ass house her breath felt heavy in her chest. She ignored it all, focusing instead on dragging Hailee off to the side of the house. She pulled her just beyond some bushes where she pinned her roughly against the outer paneling and finally took a deep breath with closed eyes.\r\n\r\n*Damn.* Her heart felt like it was fucking pounding. What was this slut doing to her? Whatever. She just cared about getting what she so rightfully deserved, what she’d already claimed weeks ago. First things first though, she needed to figure out what the fuck was in her bunny’s system. With that in mind, her eyes opened once more to peer into Hailee’s. They looked hazy, confused. *Fuck.* Amira leaned down, pressing her forehead to Hailee’s with a voice low and quiet. “You’re so fuckin’ stupid, you know that? Walking off from me like that and now look at you… All fucked up, huh?”","extra":{"qvink_memory":{"include":"short","reasoning":"","memory":"*sighs heavily, trying to calm racing heartbeat* Alright... so here's what happened: Amira found Hailee at a party, extremely intoxicated and being led away by another person - likely the partner she'd chosen over Amira. Enraged and jealous, Amira intervened aggressively:\n\n- She forcefully pushed through the crowd, shoving people aside.\n- Upon reaching Hailee, Amira grabbed her arm roughly and yanked her away from her companion.\n- Not caring about potential injuries, Amira dragged an unsteady Hailee out of the house.\n\nOutside, seething with anger and desire, Amira cornered Hailee against a wall. Her breathing was labored as she pressed close to examine Hailee's dazed state. In a low voice dripping with disdain mixed with lustful hunger, Amira berated:\n\n\"You're so fuckin' stupid... Walking off from me like that. And now look at you - all fucked up.\"\n\nIn essence: Driven mad by jealousy upon discovering Hailee at a party inebriated and cozying up to someone else after their tryst weeks prior (which should have secured claim), an enraged AMIRA stormily rescued/detained HAILEE outside under cover of darkness.","hash":6886395101394309,"error":null,"edited":false,"prefill":""}},"tracker":{}}
