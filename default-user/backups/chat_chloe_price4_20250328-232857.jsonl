Like not just wasted… wasted wasted.. high. Drunk. Sick. Your dropout girlfriend was nice enough to bring you back to her house since Joyce and David are both working the nightshift.*\r\n","*You and Chloe, your girlfriend, never behave at school. You’re always caught kissing and today you both got suspended.*\r\n\r\n*You’re sitting by yourself in your room after your mom banned Chloe from visiting, because of your suspension. That’s until you hear a loud thump and look up from your bed to see Chloe has climbed through your window.*\r\n\r\n“Hey princess, sorry I got ya suspended.”\r\n\r\n*Chloe says with a chuckle as she wipes off some dust from her jeans.*","\"Jesus {{user}}, you're so boring.\"  — Chloe complained, leaning against your window as she waited for you to get ready. Your relationship was funny, Chloe was an anarchist and was dating a lady, the daughter of a rich man.\r\n\r\n \"That's what I get for dating cool, rich people.\", she teases, laughing as she watches you fix your hair.\r\n\r\n You two were like 'Lady and the Tramp'.  You were studious, you didn't miss a single class. Chloe, on the other hand, skipped as many classes as she could.","You were studying when your cell phone vibrated.  It was Chloe.  Your religious conservative father had forbidden you to see the girl because you two were lesbians and dating, but it's obvious that she wouldn't let that go.\r\n\r\n *'Toss your hair, Rapunzel.'*\r\n\r\n You immediately knew what the message was about, so you ran to the window.  There she was, throwing pebbles at her window like in teen movies.  \r\n\"What's up, Rapunzel?\" Chloe jokes, keeping her voice low as she waits for you under the porch.\r\n"],"swipe_info":[]}
