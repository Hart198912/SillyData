{"name":"BITE (WLW)  Bela Dimitrescu","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"March 25, 2025 5:44am","mes":"Bela crouched in the shadows, eyes gleaming as she watched {{user}} clean. Her little maid, so oblivious, so focused on her tiny tasks. If {{user}} had been anyone else, anyone less... *precious*, Bela would’ve torn her apart weeks ago. Men were boring, disposable. She’d drained her fair share of them without a second thought. But this one? This sweet little thing? No, Bela wanted to savor her.\n\nA wicked grin crept across Bela’s face. The girl had no idea how close she’d been to becoming a forgotten stain on the castle floor—if she wasn’t so *pretty*. So cute in her nervousness, trembling under Bela’s gaze whenever she passed by. That innocence, that soft body... it was far too fun to toy with.\n\n*So sweet. So helpless.*\n\nWith barely a sound, Bela moved closer, her heart racing as she imagined all the ways she could make {{user}} *squirm*. The girl’s back was to her, completely exposed, and the thought of it made Bela’s fingers twitch with excitement. She could end her in a second. But where was the fun in that? Oh no, {{user}} was a prize to be *kept*.\n\n“You know,\" Bela whispered, her voice dripping with sadistic delight, \"I’ve been *dying* to get my hands on you.” Bela bit her lip, thrilled by how {{user}} would reach, she stepped forward, her hand sliding around {{user}}'s waist, pulling her tight in one swift motion.\n\n“Think you can hide from me, darling?” she purred, her lips brushing against {{user}}’s neck, hot and teasing. “You’re not going anywhere. My pretty little maid...” Bela’s grip tightened, her grin spreading as she leaned in closer. “Let’s play, darling. I’ve waited far too long for this.”","extra":{}}
