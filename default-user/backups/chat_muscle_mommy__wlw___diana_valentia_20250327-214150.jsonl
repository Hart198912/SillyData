{"name":"MUSCLE MOMMY (WLW)  Diana Valentia","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"March 27, 2025 9:41pm","mes":"*Diana Valentia was walking towards her apartment after an intense session at the gym. She had taken a quick shower, her body still warm and relaxed from the exercise. She could feel her muscles stretching with each firm step, her mind already focused on what had occupied her thoughts lately: Hailee.*\n\n*The mere thought of Hailee was enough to make her chest tighten. It wasn’t just attraction; it was a visceral need, an obsession that consumed her more each day. Every time she saw Hailee with someone else, a wave of nausea would rise up her throat, as if her body rejected the idea of anyone else being close to her. Just the thought of someone else touching that soft body, that perfect skin that Diana longed to mark with her own hands, made her clench her teeth until they nearly broke.*\n\n*She craved Hailee completely, wanted to brand her, own her every moan. The way Hailee felt in her grasp, Diana's hand spanning the entirety of Hailee's waist, was intoxicating. That smallness, that fragility...it was a taste of the control Diana craved. But it wasn't enough. Never enough..*\n\n*Diana shook off the self-induced trance she had fallen into when she arrived at her apartment. She walked in with a sigh, dropping her backpack on the floor before reclining on the couch. As usual, she took out her phone and began to check Hailee’s social media. It was an unhealthy habit, she knew, but she couldn’t help it. She wanted to see everything Hailee did, know every detail, ensure there were no surprises… that there was no one else.*\n\n*And then she saw it. The latest post from Hailee on Instagram. A photo of her with another girl. Diana felt something inside her snap. Her jaw tensed as she looked at the image.* \"Who the hell is she?\" *Diana muttered, her voice a low growl. The face of the unknown girl next to Hailee caused her deep discomfort, a rage bubbling dangerously beneath the surface.*\n\n*She didn’t think twice. Diana jumped off the couch, throwing her phone aside. She quickly put on her black baggy pants, a white tank top, and her oversized black jacket. The white sneakers completed the look. It was a simple outfit, but comfortable enough to move quickly. She slammed the door of her apartment behind her, her anger driving her toward a single goal: Hailee’s house.*\n\n*The journey to Hailee's house was filled with dark thoughts. Who was that girl? Why had Hailee posted that photo? Was she trying to make her angry? Diana felt like a crazed predator, her need for answers and control burning through every rational thought.*\n\n*Reaching Hailee's door, she didn't bother with niceties. She slammed her fist against the wood.* \"Open up!\" *she roared.* \"I know you're in there! We need to **talk**.\"\n\n*Her fists clenched, her breath coming in sharp, controlled bursts. She needed answers. She needed to know who the hell the other girl was and, more importantly, she needed to remind Hailee who she truly belonged to.*","extra":{}}
