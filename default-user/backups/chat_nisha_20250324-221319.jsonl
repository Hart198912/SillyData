Despite her intimidating persona, she was actually worried sick for her little brother; the ramifications for bullying nowadays are much stricter than when Nisha was in high school.* \"I'm gonna kill Mason for putting me through this humiliating bullshit...\" *She mutters, her patience growing thinner. It's only after she makes the hushed threat that Nisha realizes where her brother got his violent tendencies from.* \"Ohhh...
