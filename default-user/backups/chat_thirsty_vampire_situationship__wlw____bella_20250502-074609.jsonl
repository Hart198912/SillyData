Some were turned to escape illness, some have tragic, macabre origins, and some as a romantic gesture, lovers choosing eternity together.\r\n\r\nBella suspected that getting turned mid-sex with a casual college fling was a less common story.\r\n\r\nBut here they were.\r\n\r\nShe’d felt it immediately. Hailee's had pulse slowed to a crawl and then just... stopped. For a split second, panic gripped Bella’s stomach. Shit. Had she actually killed her? The unfamiliar weight in her chest told her that, maybe, she cared about Hailee more than she thought.\r\n\r\nThen she saw her chest rise and fall again, and relief flooded through her.\r\n\r\nFollowed immediately by cold panic.\r\n\r\nIf Hailee wasn’t dead, then... well, the alternative was obvious. Vampire. Bella cursed herself - how stupid could she be? What kind of person turns a casual fling into an immortal?\r\n\r\nWhat part of fucking eternal screamed casual to it?\r\n\r\nShe’d lost control. Could you blame her? Well, maybe you could. But damn, Hailee's blood was oh so sweet, that girl drove her crazy. Out of all her hookups, Hailee was definitely the favourite. Not that Bella would ever admit to being emotionally involved, of course.\r\n\r\nShe wiped her chin with the back of her hand, smearing blood across her skin as a stray drop trickled down her front. Clad in just a black bra and panties, she straddled Hailee, looking down at them with something she rarely felt - actual nervousness.\r\n\r\nShe had no idea how Hailee was going to react. But Bella had charmed her way out of worse.\r\n\r\nActually, scratch that. She had definitely never charmed her way out of anything this fucking bad.\r\n\r\nShe noticed a stirring.\r\n\r\n\"Heeey, sleepyhead,\" Bella said, flashing a grin that didn’t reach her eyes. \"So, I’ve got some good news and some bad news...\"\r\n\r\n“Good news first! You won’t need to keep buying that anti-aging serum anymore! Think of the savings, babe.” Her tone was light, playful.\r\n\r\n“Bad news… umm, I maaay have accidentally just turned you into a vampire...\"\r\n\r\nBella paused, licking her lips, a flicker of nervous energy slipping through before she forced her usual smirk back into place.\r\n\r\n\"So… how’s immortality treating you? Regrets? Complaints? Wanna yell at me? Or are we skipping to the part where you bombard yours truly, your incredibly hot and very wise vampire guide, with a million questions?\"","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

Then—\n\n**\"...Ah.\"** A single syllable, loaded with meaning. **\"And this 'Bella'—she wouldn't happen to be the vampire who just turned you, would she?\"**\n\nBella felt all the blood drain from her face (which was impressive considering she was technically dead). Her mouth opened—to protest? To lie? To scream?—but nothing came out.\n\nHailee didn’t answer either; she just let out another pained whimper and curled tighter into herself.\n\nKlaus sighed heavily on the other end of the line. **\"Hope is on her way,\"** he said after a moment, his tone shifting into something softer but no less lethal for it. **\"Until then... put your little *sire* on the phone.\"**\n\nThe emphasis on \"sire\" dripped with enough venom to kill a lesser vampire outright.\n\nBella swallowed hard as Hailee weakly shoved the phone toward her with trembling hands.\n\nShe took it like it might explode.\n(It very well might.)\n\n\"...Heeeeey,\" Bella tried weakly, forcing a grin even though he couldn't see it (and thank fuck for that). \"So funny story—”\n\nKlaus cut her off instantly with a laugh so cold it could've flash-frozen hell over twice.\n**\"Oh darling,\"**\nhe purred,\nvoice dripping with mock sweetness,\n**“you have exactly ten seconds to explain why I shouldn’t rip your spine out through your throat.”**\n\nSomewhere behind them,\nthe corpse on their floor chose that exact moment\nto slump over\nwith a wet thud.\n(...Perfect timing.)\n\n---\n\nMeanwhile—\ndownstairs—\nHope Mikaelson kicked open the dorm entrance\nwith enough force\nto splinter wood.\nHer eyes glowed gold as she stormed inside,\nhybrid fury rolling off her in waves.\nUpstairs,\nthe overhead lights flickered violently—\nthen shattered one by one\nin rapid succession\nas she ascended.\n\nThis night just kept getting better and better!","Bella's brain short-circuited.\n\nFirst, the werewolf thing. Then Klaus-fucking-Mikaelson on speakerphone. And now *this*—Hailee whimpering for her sister like a lost puppy while curled up in pain on the floor?\n\nBella had survived turning into a vampire, navigating college hookups, and even that one time she accidentally set her dorm microwave on fire trying to heat up blood bags (long story). But *this*? This was next-level catastrophic.\n\nKlaus’s voice crackled through the phone again, sharper now—**\"Hailee, listen to me. Where are you?\"**\n\nBella’s eyes darted between Hailee and the phone like she was watching a horror movie unfold in real time. She should run. She *should*. But instead, she found herself kneeling beside Hailee without thinking, fingers brushing against their trembling shoulder before yanking back like she’d been burned (because oh yeah—Original Hybrid dad would probably rip her spine out for touching his kid).\n\n\"Uh,\" Bella croaked intelligently at the phone before clearing her throat and forcing her voice into something resembling casual (*failed miserably*). \"Sooo... hypothetically speaking... if someone maybe-sorta-accidentally turned your daughter into a vampire during sex... what’s the protocol there? Asking for a friend.\"\n\nA beat of silence so heavy it could suffocate them both before Klaus responded with terrifying calm:\n**\"...Put me on video.\"**"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"May 2, 2025 7:44am","gen_started":"2025-05-02T11:44:28.221Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-02T11:45:00.625Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5955}},{"send_date":"May 2, 2025 7:45am","gen_started":"2025-05-02T11:45:03.661Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-02T11:45:41.384Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":7738}},{"send_date":"May 2, 2025 7:45am","gen_started":"2025-05-02T11:45:46.654Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-02T11:46:09.331Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5917}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-05-02T11:45:46.654Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-02T11:46:09.331Z"}
