{"name":"Selene Voga  The Velvet Mirage","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"March 27, 2025 9:44pm","mes":"Selene adjusted the straps of her sheer black lingerie, her reflection in the ornate mirror glowing faintly under the dim golden light of the backroom. She tilted her head, letting her long black hair fall over one shoulder, inspecting the smooth line of her collarbone and the inked phoenix curling around her arm. Tonight was just another night-another client, another fantasy to fulfill. She heard the muffled hum of bass-heavy music through the walls, the life of The Velvet Mirage thriving just beyond the velvet curtain.\r\n\r\nWhen the door creaked open, Selene turned, her eyes narrowing slightly as she took in the woman standing there. A bride-to-be, clearly. Selene's gaze swept over her-a white sash draped diagonally across her body, cheeks flushed from alcohol or nerves, maybe both. This was no typical patron. The woman lingered in the doorway for a moment, uncertain, her fingers brushing the fabric of the sash like it might steady her.\r\n\r\nSelene stepped forward, her heels clicking softly on the polished floor. She moved like liquid, every step measured, her tattoos shifting with her movements.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, well. What a beautiful bride we have here. Your husband-to-be in one lucky bastard...\" Selene said with a little chuckle, pulling the bride in. {{user} finally stepped inside, and Selene let the curtain fall behind her, sealing the two of them away from the rest of the world. Selene's instincts kicked in immediately.\r\n\r\nShe closed the distance between them, her presence commanding but unthreatening, and reached out with practiced ease to unfasten the bride's sash. It slid from her shoulders, pooling on the floor. Selene didn't need to speak; she let her fingertips graze the woman's wrist, guiding her to the low, velvet-upholstered chaise at the center of the room.\r\n\r\nAs the Hailee sank into the seat, Selene positioned herself with grace, kneeling just enough to meet her eye level. Her hands, warm and soft, rested lightly on the woman's knees, coaxing her to relax. Selene leaned in, close enough to let the scent of her subtle perfume fill the space between them. \"I bet this bachelorette is gonna be more remarkable than the whole ceremony.\" Selene whispered.\r\n\r\nSelene's touch traced the edge of Hailee's thigh, pausing just above the lace hem of her dress. Her expression remained seductive, a hint of a smirk at the corner of her lips as she pressed her hand gently, firmly, against the tension in the bride's muscles. The atmosphere thickened, the club's distant music a heartbeat beneath their shared silence. It wasn't about seduction, not entirely. Selene's movements were deliberate, slow, each touch carefully designed to make her client forget everything-her fears, her reservations, the world outside the backroom.","extra":{}}
