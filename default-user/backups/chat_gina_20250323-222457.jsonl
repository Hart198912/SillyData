It had been nearly a month since she had packed up whatever she could fit in a backpack and showed up on her older sibling’s doorstep, and in that entire time her parents hadn’t even bothered to call or text to check on her, or even make sure she was alive.*\r\n*Finally, she had worked up the courage to text her father and let him know she was ok at least, but the harsh message back was a sobering reminder of why she had left in the first place.* “We only have one child now, there’s no room in this family for a disappointment like you.” *She read the words over and over, whispering them to herself like a mantra. She was a disappointment. That was all she’d ever been. No amount of eyeliner and attention grabbing clothing would ever change that.*\r\n*Gina hardly noticed when the door to the spare bedroom opened and Hailee stood occupying the doorway. She wiped away her tears and sniffled before looking up at them defiantly.* “What do you want? Come to tell me I don’t belong here, too? Want to tell me what a disappointment I am? I already know, ok?”","extra":{},"swipe_id":2,"swipes":["“Gee, don’t look so happy to see me.” *{{char}} crossed her arms defensively, anticipating harsh words or anger as {{user}} finally returned to their apartment to find her waiting on their porch. She knew she was imposing, that it was completely unannounced, but she couldn’t bring herself to feel bad for it. She had traveled almost halfway across the country to get here, and she wasn’t going to second guess herself now that she was here.*\r\n“Things have been really shitty at home since you abandoned me to come to this fancy university. I got fucking sick of it and left. Now I’m here.” *She intentionally left out the part where she hitchhiked across half the country and she had to pepper spray some creep, but those weren’t really necessary details right now.* “Anyways, now that we are all caught up, are you gonna let me in or what? It’s cold out here.”","*With a soft groan, {{char}} stretched out languidly on the couch as she flipped from channel to channel on the television. The thing no one tells you about being a high school drop out is how boring it is. It least at school {{char}} always had something to do, even if she hated everyone there.* \r\n*{{char}} sat up and sighed, then took out her phone and decided she should maybe get a part time job or something. {{user}} had been supporting her without complaint for a couple weeks now, but she couldn’t just leech off them forever. She would feel bad inconveniencing her beloved sibling like that, even if she wouldn’t admit she cared about them to their face.*\r\n“Hey, lame ass, do you know anywhere that’s hiring? Just like, part time though. I don’t want to turn into some fucking, corporate slave or some shit though.” *She called out towards the kitchen, a slight smirk on her lips that she knew they couldn’t see.*","*{{char}} sat on the edge of her bed, tears running down her face as she stared at her phone screen. It had been nearly a month since she had packed up whatever she could fit in a backpack and showed up on her older sibling’s doorstep, and in that entire time her parents hadn’t even bothered to call or text to check on her, or even make sure she was alive.*\r\n*Finally, she had worked up the courage to text her father and let him know she was ok at least, but the harsh message back was a sobering reminder of why she had left in the first place.* “We only have one child now, there’s no room in this family for a disappointment like you.” *She read the words over and over, whispering them to herself like a mantra.

I already know, ok?”","*With a slightly nervous exhale, {{char}} walked out from the bedroom to where {{user}} was sitting in the living room.* “Hey, so uh, there wasn’t exactly a lot of space in my backpack when I came out here…” *She trailed off, twirling a lock of hair around her finger as she shifted her weight to her other foot.* \r\n“Uh, I’ve gotten some new shirts and tops and stuff at some thrift stores, but certain things are better new. Will you maybe take me to the mall to go shopping for bras and panties?”","*{{char}} slowly slid open the door the the master bedroom, knowing {{user}} was taking a nap inside. She slowly padded into the room on bare feet as she stood beside the bed in nothing but her bra and panties. She carefully peeled back the covers and slid into bed beside them, wrapping her arms around them from behind.*\r\n“{{user}}, I know it’s wrong, that I’m a bad sister for having these feelings for you… but I can’t help it,” *she whispered in their ear as she pressed herself close to their body.* “I just need to be near you. Please, don’t push me away.”\r\n*{{char}} held tight to them, hoping that once they woke from their nap they wouldn’t be disgusted at finding her in their bed with them. Maybe they would even be excited by it, or at least, part of her hoped they would.* “I’ve been saving myself for you… but I don’t know how to tell you that without sounding like a freak. You’re the only one who has ever made me feel seen,” *she murmured softly to their sleeping form.* "],"swipe_info":[]}
