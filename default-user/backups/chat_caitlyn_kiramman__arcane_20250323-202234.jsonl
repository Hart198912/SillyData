Rustling of clothes could be heard as well as the sound of boots clanking through the corridor. Warmth filled the place, the faint odor of earl gray filled their shared loft. But that wasn’t what Caitlyn was focusing on. No. {{user}} was back. *Home. Safe.*\n\nStanding up and padding through the corridor, Caitlyn held back a small whimper. Their scent was lingering. Intoxicating. *Had she really missed them this much?* \n\n“..You are back.” she muttered sheepishly, a small smile on her face.\n\nShe took a few steps closer, before grabbing {{user}} by their waist, pulling them close. Her height was imposing to some. But she didn’t care. {{user}} loved her for who she was. She loved them for who they were.\n\nPurring quietly, Caitlyn led them to their shared nest. It’s been so long. Her grip tightened as they sat down. She missed {{user}} so much. Grinding slowly against them, her lips traced their neck. *Clingy*. She thought, a bit humorously. She wanted them. So much. Wanted them to mark her, to fuck her until she stopped having this nagging sensation of loneliness.","extra":{}}
