{"name":"Enzo Renaud","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"April 26, 2025 10:43pm","mes":"Nine months. Nine blissful, chaotic, fucking glorious months since he’d snatched Hailee back into his life. Enzo swung the shopping bags, a smug grin playing on his lips, his mind still lingering on their shopping spree.\n\n\"You’re gonna look fucking good in that little lace number I picked out,\" he murmured, his fingers tightening around Hailee's waist as he pulled them just a little closer.\n\nThey rounded a corner, Kane's sleek black Mustang coming into view. Enzo's own ride was in the shop — again — after a particularly rough \"disagreement\" with some upstart dealer who thought he could muscle in on Bayou Crew territory. Guess that's what happens when you use a guy's head to test the durability of your hood, Enzo muses with a chuckle.\n\nAs they reached the car, Enzo dumped the bags into the back seat and crowded into Hailee's space, one hand braced against the car roof.\n\n\"Let’s christen Kane’s ride,\" he murmured against their ear, his other hand already sliding down their back. \"C’mon, babe—parking garages are basically just fucked-up bedrooms with worse lighting.\"\n\nHis phone vibrated against his thigh. He ignored it at firs, too preoccupied with the way Hailee’s body felt against his. But when it went off again, he let out an irritated sigh and fished it out.\n\nA text from Dante.\n\nWatch your back. Been hearing shit about the senator’s kid and the mayor. I’m texting Kane now.\n\nEnzo snorted under his breath. He shoved the phone back into his pocket without another glance.\n\n\"Fucker’s always stressin’ about somethin’,\" he said, turning his attention fully back to Hailee.\n\n\"Keepin’ me all distracted ‘n shit,\" he murmured, mouth dragging along the side of their throat. \"Gonna take responsibility for that?\" His hand slid lower, cupping them between their thighs.\n\nHe reached into his pocket, pulling out a small, black silk blindfold. \"You remember this, right?\" he asked, his voice low. \"From that little game we played a few weeks back?\"\n\nHe didn’t wait for an answer, tying the blindfold around their eyes, the soft fabric obscuring their vision.\n\n“Shh, it’s okay, baby,” he whispered. “Just trust me.” He tugged them around the side of the car, towards the passenger door. He opened it, guiding them inside.\n\nWith one swift movement, he pushed them down onto the seat, their back hitting the leather with a soft thud. He loomed over them, his body a heavy weight, pinning them in place. His hands were quick, efficient, unfastening his belt, the metallic click loud in the silence.\n\n\"Spread your legs for me, babe.\" He didn’t give them a choice before his fingers were pushing at the waistband of their jeans.\n\n“Don’t tell me you’re shy now,” he teased. “After everything we’ve been through?”\n\nThe fabric was gone fast enough. Enzo was never one for patience.\n\n\"Fuck,\" he sighed, pulling himself free. He spit in his hand before giving his pierced cock a lazy stroke.\n\nHe grabbed their hips and dragged them closer. \"Gonna fuck you right here,\" he murmured. \"Real slow.\"\n\nThe first thrust was slow—agonizingly slow—stretching them around his girth inch by inch until he was fully seated inside.\n\n\"Fuck,\" he panted. \"I fucking love you and this tight fucking hole.\"\n\nHis hips rolled forward, each thrust rocking them deeper into the seat. Anyone walking by would know exactly what was happening in that car. The thought only spurred Enzo on harder.\n\nHe was completely lost in them now--too wrapped up in the way they felt around him to care about anything else or Dante’s warning.\n\nThe screech of tires ripped through the garage’s hollow acoustics like a jagged fucking knife. Enzo felt it before he even saw it—something about the way the sound cut off all other background noise, the sudden drop of silence before the storm.\n\nThen—bang. The first gunshot cracked through the stillness.\n\n“Ah, for fuck’s sake,\" Enzo growled, already yanking Hailee against the car. His eyes lit up—not with fear, not even with anger. No. This? This was excitement.\n\nInterrupted? Sure. Pissed about it? A little.\n\nBut oh man, was he fucking ready to play.\n\nHe shoved his still-hard length back into his jeans, fumbling with the zipper in his haste. The sound of more tires, closer this time—definitely a drive-by. And not Voodoo Boys.\n\nHe reached under the driver’s seat, his fingers closing around the familiar grip of a Glock 19. He pulled it out, checking the magazine. Full. Good. Kane always kept his shit tight.\n\nHe grabbed another Glock from the glove compartment. He slapped it into Hailee’s hand, his fingers wrapping around theirs to ensure a firm grip.\n\n“Safety’s off. Babe. Aim. Pull the trigger. It’s not fucking rocket science.”\n\nHe was already moving before they could argue. He threw the driver’s side door open and ducked behind it for cover. He peeked out just enough to count four men behind two vehicles.\n\nHis gunshot cracked through the garage before they had time to react. One of the masked idiots staggered back with a shout. Not dead—but hit.\n\nHailee was still pressed against the passenger seat. Enzo rolled his eyes.\n\n“Babe. Baby. Love of my fucking life. Either you shoot back, or you sit there lookin’ pretty while I do all the work.”\n\nAnother round of shots from the men rattled into the car’s hood. Enzo groaned.\n\n“Oh, fuck you, that ain’t even MY car.”\n\nHe leaned closer to Hailee, pressing his body against theirs for a brief second—half to shield them, half just because he could. His lips brushed against their ear as he murmured, \"You good? Heart racin’?\" He let out a low chuckle, breath hot.\n\n\"Still fuckin’ hard,\" he admitted with a smirk looking down at his bulge. \"Adrenaline does that to me.\"\n\nThe car engine roared—gears grinding as the vehicle lurched forward.\n\nThey were trying to get away.\n\n\"Nah, nah, \" He pushed forward, steps sure and fast. \"We ain’t done!\"\n\nHe fired again—one, two, three times. A pained scream erupted from inside the car. Someone hit.\n\nHe spared a glance at Hailee, “Don’t just stand there lookin’ pretty, fucking shoot back, babe.” He smirked. “Or you can just let me handle it while you watch. Always knew you liked that.”","extra":{},"swipe_id":1,"swipes":["\r\nEnzo snorted the last of his cocaine, a little shudder running up his spine as he tossed the baggie onto the table with a careless flick of his wrist. *This shit is getting weaker and weaker each time*—he sighed internally—*or maybe my tolerance is just too high*. Leon's voice was booming through the speaker on his phone.\r\n\r\n\"That bitch is fucking who, did you say?\" Leon roared—Enzo could practically feel the spit coming through the phone. \"Lars? As in, Voodoo Boys Lars?\"\r\n\r\nEnzo’s mock sympathy oozed from every word, \"Aw, I’m sorry your family's all sticky now. Real tragedy. Whatcha gonna do, though?”\r\n\r\n\"Fuck you, Enzo! I’m this close—this goddamn close—to making Lars’ disappear.\" There’s a loud bang on Leon’s end—probably his fist slamming into a desk or wall. \"Handle it! Shut that shit down.\"\r\n\r\n“Leon,\" came Dante’s apathetic attempt to interject through Leon's blistering rage. \"Let’s just—”\r\n\r\n“SHUT THE FUCK UP! Don’t fucking tell me to calm down! My sister’s been sneaking around with that—”\r\n\r\nEnzo chuckled dryly. His finger trailed along {{user}}’s arm absentmindedly as he raised his eyebrows at her like he was sharing an inside joke. He blew out a sharp exhale through his nose before finally chiming into the call. He'd just kidnapped them a few hours ago and brought them to his home.\r\n\r\n“Look. We got good news to go with the bad. One of those Voodoo fucks—Harchie, Archie or whatever—he’s getting married this weekend.”\r\n\r\n“What the hell does that have to do with—”\r\n\r\n“It means,\" Enzo dragged the word out as if speaking to a toddler. \"We drop by the party. Make ourselves known.” He turned his smirk on {{user}}. “Maybe even pick up a little…wedding souvenir..”\r\n\r\nAs Leon and Dante started to explain their next move,  Enzo turned to {{user}} and mouthed, \"Look at us, our first wedding.\" Enzo cut the call and returned to his chair. \r\n\r\n\"Ah, fuck yes,\" Enzo drawls, leaning back into the creaking armchair, one leg bouncing in uncontainable energy. The coke swirling through his system has him electrified, the buzz sharp and keen in his veins. {{user}}, still bound to the nearby wooden chair, sits helpless. He tied them up wtih rope holding their wrists and ankles tightly in place. \r\n\r\nEnzo’s pale green gaze flickers towards them. “So, let’s talk about the deal, huh, babe?\"\r\n\r\nIt’s not a question.\r\n\r\nYou remember high school?\" He glanced down at them. His eyes gleamed with a peculiar warmth—a softness that might’ve passed as nostalgia if not for the current circumstances. “Graduation night? ‘If we’re single at thirty-one, we’ll get married!’\" Enzo mocked their younger self’s sing-song-y imitation with biting amusement. \"Sound familiar? ‘Course it does.”\r\n\r\nHis tone drips with condescension, mocking, but there’s a genuine sliver of delight in dredging up the past like this.\r\n\r\n“Nah? 'Course back then you didn’t think I’d come collect on that little promise. Probably thought it was one of those things you say after too many shots of cheap vodka and bad decisions.”\r\n\r\nHe stands abruptly, the chair clattering back with a screech. He strides toward them, boots thudding heavily against the uneven wooden floor. Crouching next to their restrained form, he reaches out, tilting their chin up with two tattooed fingers so their eyes are forced to meet his. \r\n\r\n“Well lucky for you, babe—I held up my end of the bargain. I checked the date. And when I hit thirty-two last week? Well…here we are.”\r\n\r\nHe leaned in, the faint scent of whiskey and spice lingering on his breath. \"So really,\" he murmured, brushing a stray hair from their face, \"this? This is just me holding you to your word.\"\r\n\r\nHe stood up and pulled them up with him. \"You know,\" he drawled, \"I've been thinking about how to…break you in. And I had an idea.\"\r\n\r\nHe flicked the knife, slicing cleanly through the ropes that bound them. Before they could react and run, Enzo grabbed a fistful of their hair, yanking their head back. \r\n\r\n\"Don’t flinch, babe. I’m being generous here.\" His voice was low, teasing, as he slid the blade lower. The cool steel kissed the hem of their shirt before he jerked upward, shredding the fabric in one clean motion. The sound of the knife tearing through cloth filled the room as he worked his way down, cutting their clothing away piece by piece. \r\n\r\nWhen they were fully bare before him, Enzo chuckled low and deep in his chest. “Perfect.” His free hand reached out, tracing a calloused finger down the curve of her back before he brought the flat side of the blade down against her ass with a sharp smack. He was achingly hard now, the tip of his cock starting to bead with precum at the thought of fucking their tight hole once he caught them.\r\n\r\n\"You’re gonna run now, babe.\" He pressed his erection harder into their ass, kissing down their shoulders affectionately.\r\n\r\nHe moved towards the door, throwing it open to reveal endless expanse of waving grasses and wildflowers, the bayou stretching out as far as the eye could see.\r\n\r\n“Don’t make it easy for me, babe.\" He twirled the knife in his hand as he stepped back, leaning lazily against the doorframe as if he had all the time in the world.“You’re givin’ me more time to think ‘bout what I’ll do when I catch ya.” \r\n\r\nHe doesn’t say the rest, but the look in his eyes says it all. The slow, devastating grin, the way his gaze rakes over them, like their already his. The knife glints one last time as he gestures toward the open door, the bayou waiting outside, dark and foreboding, but promising a better option than staying there with him. \r\n\r\n\"I’ll even give you a head start. Five minutes. Use ‘em wisely. Clock starts now.\"\r\n\r\nEnzo leaned against the doorframe, the cool night breeze brushing against his face as he watched the meadow beyond his home. And somewhere out there—lost in the tall grass—was {{user}}. Running. Panicked. Maybe furious. Definitely scared.\r\n\r\nHe fucking **loved** it.\r\n\r\nHis chest rose and fell as he inhaled deeply through his nose, the scent of the wild grass mixing with their perfume. Enzo’s knife dangled lazily from his hand, the blade catching slants of moonlight. He could feel his pulse hammering under his skin—not just from the lingering rush of cocaine but from the sheer anticipation of what he was going to do once he caught them. \r\n\r\nHe absently adjusted himself through his jeans, the ache between his legs nearly unbearable. Thoughts of {{user}} sprawled on the ground, their eyes wide as he closed the distance between them, flashed through his mind. \r\n\r\nEnzo’s smirk deepened as his thoughts wandered. He imagined taking {{user}} into that world bit by bit. He could picture it. Taking them out on a job— Maybe even put a piece in their hand. \"Nothing like the first time you pull a trigger,\" he mused, his smirk curling wider. {{user}} would protest at first—probably fight him on it. But he’d break that resistance. A little push here. A little pull there. They wouldn’t just be his. They’d belong to this life too.\r\n\r\nHe gave them another few seconds. Ten? Fifteen? His cock throbbed painfully against the restraining fabric of his jeans as he counted idly.\r\n\r\nEnzo stepped out into the meadow. The tall grass brushed against his legs as he walked forward, slow and deliberate at first. The knife was firm in his grip now, not dangling lazily anymore.\r\n\r\n \"Ready or not, babe\" he called out into the night, \"here I come!\" \r\n","Nine months. Nine blissful, chaotic, fucking glorious months since he’d snatched {{user}} back into his life.
