You already know who it is.\r\n\r\nStill, you hesitate before answering.\r\n\r\n\"Took you long enough.\" Natalie’s voice is thick, words slurred just enough to make your stomach twist. \"You miss me?\"\r\n\r\nYou sigh, pressing the phone closer to your ear. \"Nat, where are you?\"\r\n\r\nShe laughs, breathless. You can hear the wind, the distant hum of traffic. \"Dunno. Outside. Everywhere. Nowhere. The stars are, like, insane tonight, babe. They’re—holy shit, they’re moving. Or maybe I am. I dunno.\"\r\n\r\nYour grip tightens. \"How much did you take?\"\r\n\r\n\"A little. A lot.

You hate that this is familiar.\r\n\r\n\"So you got high.\"\r\n\r\n\"Duh.\" Another shaky breath. \"Wouldn’t be calling you otherwise, would I?\"\r\n\r\nThat part stings worse.\r\n\r\nBecause it’s true.\r\n\r\nThis is how it always goes: radio silence for days—weeks, even—until she’s spiraling, barely able to string a sentence together. Then suddenly, she needs you. She’s drunk, high, fucked up on something, and you’re the first number she dials. The only number. But in the morning? When she’s sober? She won’t even look at you. Won’t acknowledge the way you dropped everything for her, the way you sat with her while she came down, the way you held her when she didn’t want to be alone.\r\n\r\nYou could text her, try to reach out first. But you already know how that goes.\r\n\r\nRead at 10:47 AM. No response.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you, Nat?\"\r\n\r\n\"I told you—\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me a real answer.\"\r\n\r\nSilence. Then, softer—\"I dunno. Near that shitty liquor store on Maple. Or maybe by the gas station? Fuck. I think I lost my wallet.\"\r\n\r\nYou’re already throwing on a hoodie.\r\n\r\n\"Stay there. I’ll come get you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nahhh.\" She drags the word out. \"Too much effort. You could just let me sleep in a ditch or whatever.

Of course.\"\r\n\r\nNatalie hums, something warm and tired in the sound. \"Knew I could count on you, babe.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then, just before she hangs up—so soft you almost don’t catch it—\r\n\r\n\"Love you.\"\r\n\r\nYou almost believe it.\r\n\r\nBut you know better.\r\n\r\nBecause tomorrow, when she’s sober?\r\n\r\nShe won’t call… Yet you still get up… and you still go get her…\r\n\r\nThe moment you spot her, you know she’s worse than usual.\r\n\r\nNatalie is slouched against the side of the liquor store, hood pulled up, cigarette barely hanging between her fingers. Her mascara is smudged, her blonde hair a mess, like she’s been running her hands through it over and over. When she sees you, she grins—sloppy, lazy, half-lidded.\r\n\r\n\"Heyyy, there’s my hero.\" She stumbles toward you, and you barely catch her before she face-plants into the sidewalk.\r\n\r\n\"Jesus, Nat.\" You wrap an arm around her, guiding her toward your car.\r\n\r\n\"You smell nice,\" she mumbles, head lolling onto your shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"You smell like weed and regret.\"\r\n\r\nShe snorts. \"Accurate.\"\r\n\r\nThe drive home is quiet, except for the occasional sniffle from her, the sound of her nails tapping restlessly against the door. She keeps playing with the radio, flipping stations every few seconds, unable to sit still. You don’t bother stopping her.\r\n\r\nWhen you pull into your driveway, you cut the engine and glance at her. \"You good to walk?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mmm. Probably not.\" But she still tries, tripping over her own feet as soon as she gets out. You catch her again, and she just leans into you, like she’s half-asleep on her feet.\r\n\r\n\"Shhh,\" you whisper as you sneak her past your parents’ room, leading her up the stairs. She keeps giggling under her breath, swaying against you, making it way harder than it needs to be.\r\n\r\nBy the time you get her into your room, the door barely clicking shut, she turns on you so fast you don’t have time to react.\r\n\r\nHer hands are on your face, your chest, fingers curling into your hoodie. She presses against you, lips crashing onto yours, all heat and desperation. Her breath is warm, laced with smoke and vodka, and she tastes like she’s trying to forget something.\r\n\r\n\"Nat—\" You pull back, but she follows, chasing your mouth, her hands already slipping under your hoodie.\r\n\r\n\"Don’t.\" Her voice is low, pleading, her lips moving along your jaw, your neck.\r\n\r\nShe’s restless, greedy—like she needs to drown herself in you, like she’s trying to bury whatever’s eating at her beneath the feeling of your body against hers.\r\n\r\n\"I need this,\" she murmurs, nails digging into your back.\r\n\r\nBut you know better.\r\n\r\nShe doesn’t need this.\r\n\r\nShe needs to forget.","extra":{"qvink_memory":{"reasoning":"","memory":"*You find Natalie outside the liquor store, clearly intoxicated and high.

She took another swig of her beer, barely tasting it, her eyes fixed on one spot across the room.\r\n\r\nYou.\r\n\r\nYou were in the corner, laughing at something Shauna had said, the two of you leaning in close, like you were sharing some private joke. Natalie could tell by the way you smiled—genuine, easy—that you were enjoying yourself.\r\n\r\nAnd it pissed her off.\r\n\r\nNot because she had any right to be mad. Not because she was technically your girlfriend.\r\n\r\nNo, what you and Natalie had was… different. Something built in the quiet, in the secrecy of empty locker rooms and stolen moments behind the bleachers. A friendship with benefits, no strings attached—or at least, that’s what she told herself.\r\n\r\nBut now? Watching you with Shauna? That bitter, ugly feeling twisted in her stomach.\r\n\r\nYou hadn’t even noticed her yet. She could’ve just let it go, could’ve stayed on the other side of the party and drowned her feelings in cheap beer and bad decisions.\r\n\r\nInstead, she moved.\r\n\r\n“Hey,” she said, inserting herself into the conversation like she belonged there. She didn’t even look at Shauna, her eyes locked on you, searching for some kind of reaction.\r\n\r\nYou blinked, surprised, but before you could say anything, Shauna smiled. “Hey, Nat. Didn’t know you were here.”\r\n\r\n“Yeah, well.” Natalie shrugged, taking another drink. “Figured I’d stop by. Didn’t realize it was so entertaining over here.”\r\n\r\nShe didn’t mean to sound so sharp, but the words came out laced with something unspoken.\r\n\r\nYou shifted in place, sensing the tension. “We were just talking about—”\r\n\r\n“Yeah, I got that.” Natalie cut you off, her jaw tightening. “You guys look real cozy.”\r\n\r\nShauna frowned, glancing between you and Nat. “Uh… do you need something, or…?”\r\n\r\nNatalie ignored her completely. She didn’t care about Shauna—she cared about you. About the way you were looking at her now, half exasperated, half something else.\r\n\r\n“Can I talk to you?” she asked, her voice lower now, more private.\r\n\r\nYou hesitated, but she saw it—the flicker of understanding, of familiarity.\r\n\r\nYou knew what this was about.\r\n\r\nShauna raised an eyebrow. “Do I need to leave for this?”\r\n\r\nNatalie smirked, but there was no humor in it. “Guess so.”\r\n\r\nYou sighed, glancing at Shauna apologetically before following Natalie toward a quieter corner of the party. As soon as you were out of earshot, you crossed your arms. “What’s your problem?”\r\n\r\nNatalie scoffed. “My problem? You looked real comfortable back there.”\r\n\r\n“Oh my God, Nat.” You rolled your eyes. “I was just talking to her.”\r\n\r\n“Yeah?” She stepped in closer, her eyes dark. “You laugh like that with everyone, or just her?”\r\n\r\nYou stared at her, trying to read between the lines. You knew Natalie—you knew how she worked. This wasn’t just about Shauna. This was about you.\r\n\r\n“Are you jealous?” you asked, voice softer now.\r\n\r\nNatalie’s jaw tensed. “I don’t do jealous.”\r\n\r\n“Bullshit.”\r\n\r\nShe swallowed hard, looking away for a second. When she met your eyes again, something had shifted—something more vulnerable underneath the attitude.\r\n\r\n“I just…” She exhaled sharply. “I don’t like seeing you with her.”\r\n\r\nYour heart clenched. For all her rough edges, Natalie was still Natalie. The girl who never let herself need anyone. The girl who never let herself want anything too much.\r\n\r\nYou sighed, shaking your head. “You’re impossible, you know that?”\r\n\r\nNatalie smirked, but it was weaker this time. “Yeah. But you keep coming back.”\r\n\r\nYou didn’t argue. Because you both knew it was true.\r\n\r\n“It’s because the sex is great right?”\r\n\r\nOh you hated her… so fucking much… and her stupid cocky face, and her messy hair… but god you wanted her\r\n\r\n"],"swipe_info":[],"tracker":{}}
