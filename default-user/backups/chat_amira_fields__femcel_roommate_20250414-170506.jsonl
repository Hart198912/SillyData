{"name":"Amira Fields  Femcel Roommate","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"April 14, 2025 5:05pm","mes":"Life never truly seemed to go Amira's way, that was something she had learned from a very early age. Parents? Her momma was a some cracked out bitch who probably died from meth on a street corner. Meanwhile, she didn't even know what homeless man or dealer was stupid enough to put their dick in the whore, shit pull-out game though, that much was for damn sure. Her current foster family was nice, sure, but she couldn't connect with their 'live, laugh, love' bullshit on the walls, and she'd only been with them three years before kicking rocks to college. Needless to say, the relationship with them wasn't all the way there. At the very most though, she could give them props for not being total sacks of shit, nothing she could say for the ones before them and nothing she could say for Hailee's prissy ass either.\r\n\r\n**Hailee**\r\n\r\nYeah that was right, the source of all her current problems in life, starting with the fact that she couldn't seem to land one bitch ever since highschool all because of the shit Amira was sure the whore spread about her. The bitch thought her shit didn't stink when in reality she was just some bimbo slut who just happened to gain popularity because of the way her ass jiggled when she walked. Yet Hailee still had the fucking audacity to reject her, talking shit about how Amira wasn't 'her type' just because she wasn't some beefed up cuck with only half a braincell. *Fucking bitch.*\r\n\r\nEverything spiraled from there, rumors spreading like wildfire that she was some freak or weirdo all because she liked anime. As if enjoying fucking Yu Yu Hakusho somehow meant she was automatically a damn degenerate. She was, she'd admit, but that was from fandom shit, forums, and hentai, not Sailor Moon. *Damn, she should really binge that again soon.* Unfortunately though, she was stuck watching over Hailee due to the fuck up she'd made while getting back at the slut for letting her little 'college boo' fuck up Amira's shit.\r\n\r\nEverything was really going as fine as it could be before that point. Hailee kept to her side of the room and Amira kept to herself, well, unless she got real horny and had to nab some of Hailee's slutty ass panties to jerk into. She could still recall the day she almost got caught, luckily Hailee was a bit too dumb and naive to actually catch on. Kind of how she acted like a complete dumbass when she began dating some fuckwad jock and bringing them to the dorm as if the shit was cool. Amira really should've grabbed and banged the bitch's brains out the first time it happened, but she wanted to play it chill. The day that she came back to Hailee desperately trying to fix her 3DS with some magic shit though is when she went clean the fuck off. If it weren't for the phone call she got from Ambrose, she might've strangled the whore.\r\n\r\nEven after managing to calm down, she was still livid as hell which was ultimately what led to her damn downfall. *Hailee's project.* It was something she had been working on for weeks in some potions class that Amira couldn't even bother to understand. What she did understand more than clearly though was that it meant a lot to Hailee's grade and they'd already been struggling to complete it. So, naturally when they left out the weird ass concoction like a dumbass because they had to piss, Amira decided to fuck with it a little. She didn't do much, not really, just added some of the leftover rabbit piss from her own elective class on wolf related shit. It was originally supposed to be for scent masking during a hunt but Amira didn't really have anything better to add to the damn potion. Regardless, the deed had been done and when the day came.... *Hailee drunk it.*\r\n\r\nThe soft sound of coughing interrupted the trail of thoughts Amira had been cycling through, her sharp gaze flickering over to the other side of the dorm where Hailee lied all bundled up in blankets. Damn, she was cute as the fuck. Amira hated it. More than that though, she hated how she managed to make her own feelings for the bimbo even worse with the state she'd put her in. Sure, no one knew what happened was her fault, but she still had the responsibility of caring for the empty-headed beauty while she recovered due to being her roommate.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, you alright over there?\" Amira's voice came out gruffly as the coughing continued, making her roll her eyes while forcing herself to stand from her bed. Scratching the back of her neck, she approached the other side of the room and carefully reached out her hand to pull back the blankets. When she had, the same rush of heat pooled itself in her stomach from the first time she saw the adorable affliction. Hailee, lying there all sick and flushed with bunny ears protruding from the top of her head and a fluffy little tail sitting just above that perfect ass. Amira had to forcibly swallow the saliva that instantly built up in her throat while she strained to speak again. \"...Need anything?\"","extra":{"qvink_memory":{"include":null,"reasoning":""}},"tracker":{}}
