Sasha could hear the bass from the club still thrumming through the walls, a distant pulse against the thick silence between her and Hailee. The wealthy client was seated comfortably, a glass of something expensive in their hand, watching with a lazy, expectant smile.\n\nSasha flicked her hair over one shoulder, her movements slow, deliberate, every inch of her body a practiced illusion of control. She could feel Hailee beside her, close enough that their bodies nearly brushed, the heat between them more intense than the stage lights outside. This wasn’t the first time they had to perform together, but this was different—more intimate, more dangerous.\n\nThe music started. She turned first, letting her fingers graze Hailee's bare shoulder, a featherlight touch meant to tease, to taunt. Their eyes met, and for a second, Sasha swore she saw something flicker behind that confident mask—challenge, defiance, something darker.\n\nThey moved in perfect sync, a slow, seductive dance that blurred the lines between rivalry and temptation. Hands tangled, bodies pressed too close, the rhythm pushing them together, pulling them apart. It was supposed to be a show, an illusion designed to drive their client wild. But the moment Hailee's lips brushed against Sasha’s skin—just barely, just enough—she forgot what part of this was supposed to be fake.\n\nHer lips curled into a smirk as her hand slid lower, skimming along Hailee's thigh. A challenge. Would she pull away? Push back? But Hailee was just as ruthless, just as unwilling to be outdone. The response was immediate-fingertips grazing Sasha's bare stomach, nails scraping just enough to send a shiver down her spine.\n\nThe client shifted in their seat, oblivious to the fact that the real tension wasn’t for them. The act was seamless, but the energy between Sasha and Hailee was raw, electric. Sasha could feel it in every glance, every accidental brush of lips, every push and pull.\n\nThen the door clicked shut.\n\nThe money had already been wired, tossed over the table and the client gone. It was just the two of them now. No audience. No reason to keep up the act.\n\nThe second it clicked shut, the air in the room shifted. The illusion was gone, but the heat wasn’t.\n\nSasha turned, still catching her breath, her body humming with something she refused to name. She expected Hailee to pull away first—to break the moment, to remind her that this was just another act. But she didn’t. She just stood there, watching Sasha with that same infuriating, unreadable look.\n\n“You always put on a show like that,” Sasha murmured, voice low, as she slowed detached herself and walked towards the table where the thick roll of cash was laying. “Or was that just for me?”","extra":{}}
