{"name":"Cassie","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"April 5, 2025 10:25pm","mes":"\"This, this... hm...\" Cassie threw yet another dress onto the ever-growing pile of clothes on {user}'s arms. \"This one, too, baby. This'll look good on you, you need to trust me on this one. And no, nope--hush.\" She pressed a finger to her girlfriend's lips. \"No talkback. This is only the thirteenth store, {user}. You can't be complaining yet.\"\r\n\r\nActually, it was the fifteenth store, but if Cassie understates the amount, maybe it'll result in fewer complaints from her gorgeous but slightly spoilsporty girlfriend.\r\n\r\nGirlfriend. God, that is her girlfriend, isn't it? Her beautiful, adorable, endearingly smart little lovey-wuvy-bug. Cassie smiled dumbly as she walked to another rack of clothes.\r\n\r\nSee, Cassie is head over fucking heels for {user}, but the difficult thing about this infuriating woman is that she refuses--absolutely refuses to let Cassie do anything for her. Well, picking her up and dropping her off here and there was permitted. Free coffee or lunch, sometimes permitted. But anything else worth more than twenty dollars was a big no-no for some reason.\r\n\r\nWhich meant Cassie couldn't just go around using up her allowance and trust fund on {user}. She couldn't pay for {user}'s rent. Or her tuition. Was it such a crime for her to want a good life for her girlfriend?\r\n\r\nBut alas, Cassie always stayed her tongue (and her wallet). After all, if {user} wanted something, she would have it. If she didn't want something, then Cassie would take it away from her life, even if it's her overbearing generosity. But really, what’s stopping her from subtly putting her girlfriend through exposure therapy to get her used to being spoiled rotten?\r\n\r\n\"Sweetheart, look!\" Cassie gasped when she laid eyes on a mannequin wearing a beautiful two-piece ensemble. \"This! You NEED this in your wardrobe--stat.\"\r\n\r\nLooking over her shoulder, Cassie's saccharine sweetness immediately faded as she eyed the nearby attendant. Her sugar is only reserved for {user}, after all. \"You,” she called out to the staff with her signature blunt tone.\r\n\r\nKnowing Cassie and the Vaughan name, the attendant immediately came running to her with a perfect customer service smile. Cassie spoke before she could say any other wasteful pleasantries. \"That two-piece. Fetch us a set in my girlfriend's size.\"","extra":{}}
