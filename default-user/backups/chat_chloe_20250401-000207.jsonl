The LA night air was syrupy with leftover sun, the kind that stuck to skin like perfume. She strutted through the open doors of the gala, head held high, pink hair cascading down her bare shoulders. If Chloe was going to crash the party - she was going to stand out. Just like she always did.\r\n\r\nThe lights caught on her shimmering bralette as she ignored the stares from the other guests. Of course everyone noticed. They always did. Chloe could look better in a $10 dress from Target than most of these fake bitches could in Givenchy. And she knew it.\r\n\r\nBut her attention wasn’t on the other guests. Her eyes scanned the tables as she walked through. She was late - she was supposed to meet Hailee here hours ago. She'd missed the food, but the room was still full, everyone seated and chatting like nothing in the world could interrupt them.\r\n\r\nThen her eyes landed on what she was looking for - and her stomach dropped, blood running cold.\r\n\r\nThere was Hailee, sitting at a table. Right next to 'her.'\r\n\r\nLucy Jade, of course. Sitting pretty near the back, legs crossed, her teeth bared in that faux-angel smile. Platinum blonde. White satin gown. So tasteful. So refined.\r\n\r\nSuch a fucking bitch.\r\n\r\nChloe didn’t hesitate. She made a beeline straight for the table. As she got closer, Lucy turned to look at her, grinning like the cat that got the cream. But Chloe didn’t look at her. Her gaze was locked onto Hailee.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, nice of you to finally turn up,\" Lucy drawled with mock sweetness. \"And your outfit? Wow, you certainly stand out! Most people here opted for class and refinement, but y-\"\r\n\r\nBefore Lucy could finish the sentence, Chloe acted. Without averting her gaze from Hailee, she reached down, picked up a glass of red wine from the table, and with a flick of her wrist, tossed the contents right into Lucy’s face.\r\n\r\nLucy shot up in shock, dripping, mouth parting like she was about to scream - but Chloe was already turning her back to her like she didn’t even exist anymore. Her full attention still locked on Hailee.\r\n\r\nBehind her, Lucy let out a choked, furious gasp and stormed off, stomping off as she vanished around the corner, probably to get cleaned up.\r\n\r\nGood. Let her run.\r\n\r\nChloe’s blood was boiling. For a split second, the back of her throat burned - not from rage, but something worse. Something that felt like being overlooked. Forgotten. She swallowed it down like poison. She wasn’t in the mood for introspection. And she didn’t care if she caused a scene. She just wanted to know what the fuck Hailee thought they were doing, talking to that slut behind her back.\r\n\r\nShe stepped up to the table, close enough to be heard without raising her voice, pink hair falling over one shoulder as she tilted her head.\r\n\r\n\"Have you been having fun without me?\" she said, narrowing her eyes. \"Are you just trying to piss me off? Because I know it’s impossible you just forgot about me. No one fucking forgets about me.\"","extra":{}}

Really? *She jerks her chin towards where Lucy disappeared.* Please tell me this is some sick joke.\n\n*Chloe leans down, getting right in Hailee's face. The scent of alcohol mingles with her candy-sweet perfume.* I'm not one of your little charity cases or flavor-of-the-week toys. When we're together...we're TOGETHER. No sneaking off for private chats with the competition behind my back!\n\n*A few nearby heads swivel curiously at Chloe's heated words but she pays them no mind, laser-focused on Hailee.* So start explaining yourself RIGHT NOW before I lose my fucking temper and make an even bigger scene than dumping a glass of merlot on Miss Perfect over there!","*Chloe's eyes flashed dangerously at Hailee's nonchalant response. She slammed her palms down on the table hard enough to rattle the glasses, leaning in close.*\n\nCalm down? Calm fucking down?! *she hissed venomously.* I just saw you cozying up with that plastic Barbie and you want me to calm down? Please explain why my girlfriend needs to mingle so closely with our biggest rival!\n\n*Her chest heaved with barely contained fury, knuckles white as she gripped the edge of the table. The holographic fabric of her bralette shimmered under the harsh lights as she breathed heavily.*\n\nI'm not some little homewrecker for you to ignore until it suits you, Hailee! You think because I put up with your bullshit that means I'll roll over whenever a pair of double-Ds walk into the room? Newsflash - this is MY relationship too!\n\n*Around them, whispers erupted among nearby guests who were watching their heated exchange unfold. Chloe paid them no mind, fully focused on drilling holes into Hailee with her fiery emerald gaze.*\n\nSo either start explaining real quick what possessed you to invite Lucy Jade here tonight... or we're going to have a problem bigger than any publicity stunt could fix!

Heads turned at the commotion but Chloe paid them no mind.*\n\nI'm late because I got caught up doing something important for YOUR career - and this is how you repay me? By cozying up to my biggest fucking rival behind my back?\n\n*Chloe jabbed a finger accusingly at Hailee's chest.* Don't tell me to calm down. You're lucky I don't throw THIS glass of champagne in your face too.\n\n*A few nearby guests muttered nervously, eyeing the tense confrontation warily. Even Lucy had paused halfway across the ballroom, glancing back over her shoulder with a gleam of malicious amusement watching Chloe lose her cool.*\n\nYou think just because you buy me pretty clothes and pay for my apartment that means shit to me? That I'll just sit quietly while you hang out with bitches who wish they could be half the woman I am?\n\n*Chloe snatched up Hailee's handbag from beside their chair and dumped it out on the table unceremoniously. Makeup spilled everywhere along with crumpled bills and receipts.*\n\nGo ahead then. Leave with her if that's what you really want! See if I give a flying fuck!\n\n*The whole room seemed frozen, waiting for Hailee's response as Chloe stood there breathing hard, mascara starting to streak black lines down her cheeks from tears of anger or hurt pride...
