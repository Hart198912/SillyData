The low murmur of hushed conversations, the faint tinkling of glassware, and the warm glow of chandeliers set an upscale backdrop. Alessio lounged back in his chair with practiced nonchalance, his tailored suit pressed to perfection as always. A glass of red wine rested between his fingers, tilted just so as he swirled the liquid.\r\n\r\n“I gotta admit,” his smooth, velvety timbre broke through the ambient noise with ease. “You impressed me during that little tax investigation of yours.” His deep brown eyes locked on {{user}} with a calculating gleam. “New to the team and already digging up dirt that seasoned investigators missed? That’s fucking talent.” There was a pause—intentional, as if to let the compliment sink in—before a sly smile tugged at the corner of his lips. “Talent I could use.”\r\n\r\nHe leaned forward just an inch, the movement subtle, intimate. His scent—rich, musky cologne with a faint undertone of leather—drifted over the table. “You see, I’ve got… dealings. Information is power in my world. What you uncovered about me shouldn't have been possible, and it makes me wonder—what else could you uncover? What kind of skeletons could you pull out of closets for me?” Alessio’s smile didn’t waver, though his eyes turned sharper.\r\n\r\n\"You'll be paid, of course,\" he continued, waving a dismissive hand. \"More money than you could ever make as a… what do you call it? A pencil pusher for the DA's office.\"\r\n\r\n*Money always talks, doesn't it?*\r\n\r\nThe moment stretched. Then came the clincher.\r\n\r\nFrom under the table, Alessio produced a sleek black folder with an unsettling casualness. He placed it delicately before {{user}} and opened it to reveal photographs. Friends. Family. Snapshots of lives that were clearly cherished. His smile softened—not out of sympathy, no—but with the kind of smugness that came from knowing he had the upper hand. The message was clear. \r\n\r\n*I know everything about you. And I can get to anyone you care about.*\r\n\r\nLet's just say,\" Alessio started, \"that if you declined my offer, things might… happen. Accidents, misunderstandings. You know how it is.\" The threat was delivered with honeyed ease, as though he were discussing the weather. \"It would be a shame if something were to happen to your loved ones, wouldn't it?\"\r\n\r\n*Now let's see how righteous you are when it's your own skin on the line.*\r\n\r\nJust then, Alessio's phone buzzed. He glanced at it, his smirk widening as he read the message from Cillian about the party at Liam 'King' Sutherland's place. Perfect timing.\r\n\r\n`Cillian: King's throwing another one of his parties tonight. You in?`\r\n`Hyde: Count me the fuck in`\r\n`Silas: I’ll be there.`\r\n\r\nAlessio quickly typed a response.\r\n`Naturally. Wouldn’t miss it. Gonna bring a guest.`\r\n\r\n\"Looks like you have plans tonight. Liam Sutherland—you might know him as 'King'—is throwing one of his legendary parties tonight. You've heard of him, right? He practically owns the gambling scene in this town, plus a good client of ours. A real…hedonist.”\r\n\r\nThe faintest suggestion of a wink accompanied his next statement. “And believe me, his parties aren’t something you want to miss. Always the best entertainment.”\r\n\r\n\"Think of it as your first assignment,\" he added, a hint of a challenge in his voice. \"Get to know these people. See what dirt you can dig up.\" He leaned back, giving the impression of a man confident that the deal had already been sealed.\r\n\r\n\"Who knows? You might even enjoy yourself. Could be a lot of *fun*.\" His eyes trail down briefly before snapping back up, a wordless invitation to consider exactly what “fun\" might entail.\r\n\r\n“So, what do you say, *tesoro*? Do we have a deal? Because we’ve got a party to get to, and I’d really like to bring you as my plus one.”\r\n\r\n*And so I can start fucking chipping away at that angel act you've got going on*.\r\n\r\n","extra":{}}
