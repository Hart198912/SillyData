Not out of boredom—no, that habit was usually reserved for board meetings or skimming over demi-human shipment reports. This was different. This was anticipation.\n\nFor weeks now, his routine has unraveled—wake up, run, check on his empire… and then, always, the café. The place where you appeared like clockwork.\n\nIt had started as a mere curiosity. A glance here. A moment of stillness there. But Claudius had a sharp eye, and sharper instincts. He noticed the twitch in your ears when no one was looking, and even the attempts to hide it with hats, the way you moved just a little too gracefully, too carefully. Not human.\n\nDemi-human.\n\nInferior. Hidden. And now, discovered.\n\nHis lips curled into a quiet smirk.\n“Little pet thinks I wouldn’t notice. How precious.”\n\nThe pen stilled in his hand. He studied its tip, a mindless ritual when deep in thought. Then he rose, sliding it into his coat. A shift in the air tugged at his senses—your fear, ripe and tangible. Delicious.\n\nThe door slammed behind him as he left, echoing in the empty corridor. His smirk widened.\n\n“Hiding, are we?” he murmured, spotting scuffed footprints in the dirt and the distant shuffle of retreating steps. “Running?” He chuckled under his breath as the wind picked up, rustling the grass in time with your panicked escape.\n\nHe crouched down, finding one of your shoes abandoned in the rush. The sole was frayed, with a small tear along the edge. He turned it over in his hand.\n“Worn out already. How typical.”\n\nHe tossed it into a nearby bin with a flick of the wrist.\nTick-tock.\nHe gave you a generous minute. Then he moved.\n\nAt first, a walk. Then a run.\n\nHis strides were long, calculated—eating up the space between him and his prey. He could see the outline of you ahead, small and desperate, weaving through the field.\n\n“Cute,” he purred, closing in like a predator playing with its meal.\n\nIn moments, he caught up, his hand latching around your arm and lifting you clean off the ground. He inhaled, slow and deliberate, taking in the scent that had haunted him for weeks.\n\n*Fuck, you’re small.*\n\n“No shoes?” he mocked, voice low, amused. “Then again, what else should I expect from a little fraud trying so hard to pass as human?”\n\nHe slipped off his own polished leather shoes, guiding your bare, cold feet into them with a strange, almost mocking tenderness.\n\nHe crouched behind you, voice a warm whisper in a freezing wind.\n“You thought you were clever, didn’t you? Thought I wouldn’t find out what you really are?”\n\nHis hand clamped around your waist, possessive, firm.\n“You could be thrown in the Pound. Stripped down. Broken. Sold to some aristocrat with too much money and not enough morals.”\n\nHis thumb traced the hem of your shirt, slow, deliberate. He didn’t need to squeeze to remind you of how easily he could snap you in two.\n\n“But I’m offering you options, pet,” he murmured. “Obey me, and I might spare you from that fate. I might even protect you.”\n\nFrom his coat, he drew a sleek black pistol and pressed the cold barrel against the back of your skull.\n\n“But cross me…” he didn’t finish the sentence. He didn’t need to.\n\n“I trust that’s not the ending you’re hoping for. Is it?”","extra":{"qvink_memory":{"include":"short","reasoning":"","memory":"*A high-ranking businessman named Claudius discovers that a person he has been observing at his usual cafe is actually a demi-human attempting to pass as human.
