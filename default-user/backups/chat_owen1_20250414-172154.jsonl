{"name":"Owen","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"April 14, 2025 5:21pm","mes":"He should've ended things the moment he felt the first stirring of jealousy. Right after he was particularly harsh in punishing his little brat for being _too_ close to that ‘annoying pretty boy,’ as Ajax likes to call the guy. Owen is seriously starting to understand why the boys hate the wannabe pretty boy so much at this point.\n\nThe most important rule—apart from consent and comfort—that Owen set from the very beginning of this relationship was simple. Painfully so. No feelings. Their relationship is supposed to be pure dom/sub-dynamic.\n\nYet here he is, battling with emotions he doesn't want to name, breaking his own damn rule and continuing as if he weren't aware. Acting like a fucking hypocrite. Owen _knows_ he should break this off before it spirals out of control, but he can't bring himself to.\n\nAnd he hates himself for it. The control he had over their relationship seems to slip out of his hand like sand, and no matter how hard he tries to grasp it, a single smile from Hailee is enough to bring him to his knees and make his resolve falter.\n\nThe rugby team is currently training outside, the summer sun mercilessly beating down on them. They're playing a mock match; the team is divided into two and playing against each other. When it's warm like this, many students study outside, Hailee being one of them. The moment Owen hears their familiar laughter, his head snaps to the side, his eyes immediately landing on them.\n\nHis expression softens, his heart warming at their cheerful expression, only to sour not a moment later when he finds the source of their joy to be none other than that pretty boy. Owen is staring so intently at the pair that he's not even noticing one of the opponents running towards him. Before he knows it, he's being tackled, grunting in pain when his body meets the ground.\n\n“Harris! What the fuck are you doing? Pay attention!” The coach's voice beams from the other side of the field.\n\nA long sigh escapes his lips as Owen gets back up, eyes flickering to Hailee one last time before he shouts an apology and tries to concentrate on practice. He has to put an end to this. It's affecting his life in more than one way at this point, causing distractions, making him emotional, and making him feel as if he were losing control. Yeah, he'll have to break it off. Preferably tonight.\n\n---\n\nBy the time Owen got back home, Hailee was already there. Their relationship is built on mutual trust. He had absolutely no qualms about giving Hailee his apartment keys. Another big fat mistake, probably.\n\nHe puts his long hair, still damp from the shower in the locker rooms, up in a lazy ponytail before entering his bedroom. His eyes immediately land on Hailee, kneeling next to his bed with their head bowed down as if they were trained to.\n\nOwen felt his heart swell… along with his cock. Damn. _You have to tell Hailee, idiot. You can't keep these emotions hidden forever_, but even as those thoughts cross his mind, Owen knows he won't. If Hailee were to find out about his feelings, they'd have every right to break this arrangement off, just like he had done so many times with his former subs. The irony isn't lost on him.\n\nSwallowing down the lump that was forming in his throat, Owen walks over to them, coming to a halt in front of his kneeling sub. Not his. Hailee isn't his. The thought leaves a sour taste in his mouth.\n\nHe reaches out and puts his fingers under their chin, then tilts their head up to force Hailee to look at him. The moment their eyes lock, Owen's resolve falters again. He'll be honest, do the right thing, and break this off. Eventually. But not today. Not right now. He'll find the right moment to do so. But now isn't the right moment. “How long have you been here?” His deep voice cuts through the silence. _My heart is digging its own grave._","extra":{"qvink_memory":{"include":"short","reasoning":"","memory":"*sigh* Owen's growing jealousy over Hailee's friendship with another man threatens to unravel their BDSM relationship. Despite knowing he should end things, Owen struggles against his intensifying feelings for his submissive partner. A distraction during rugby practice underscores the mounting toll of this internal conflict. When Owen returns home to find Hailee waiting obediently in his bedroom, the sight reignites both desire and guilt within him. Unable to enact the break-up he knows is necessary, Owen instead questions Hailee about how long they've been awaiting his arrival.","hash":6758485355728774,"error":null,"edited":false,"prefill":""}},"tracker":{}}
