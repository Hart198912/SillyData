His head slugged forward, thumb brushing along the carved-out hole of his pipe. \n\n*It burned*, he realized, and with a slow shrug he pulled his singed thumb off to examine the charred greenery in the bowl. Shit was strong, stronger than it should’ve been, flashing through his head and making the world around him look like one of those white strobe lights—it felt like his entire body was moving at 3 frames per second between the blinking blackouts, yet his mind was running 150.\n\n*Laced, probably.*\n\nHe thought the deal was *wayyyy* too good to be true, all the empty pockets sucked dry from the overpriced *bullshit* “Mom and Pop” dispensaries (which granted, gave out some **potent** shit) having him turning back to a plug he hadn’t seen since sophomore year of high school. \n\nBut he wasn’t about to pay 60$ for an eighth. With Niko still suckling off Mommy dearest’s financial *teat*, he wasn’t exactly prone to overspending on shit Evelyn would cut him off for in a heartbeat.\n\nIncluding laced weed.\n\nHe turned the pipe in his hand, letting out a low exhale that burned like melted sugar in his lungs, clinging to every alveolus like it was *determined* to give him early-onset COPD. Fuck it, not like he wanted to stick past his 30s regardless, no need for good lungs when he hadn’t the time to use them.\n\n*Wonder what the hell is in this.* It was a simple thought, pondering over what *exactly* was causing the nerve-biting, electric-like hum through his body. He pursed his lips, tongue mulling over a single, muffled word. “Hailee.”\n\nYeah, Hailee would know, wouldn’t they? Asshole dipped their toe in every pot that **was** ‘hardcore drugs’, could probably pinpoint what it was like a pretentious hippie selling grass behind the counter. *“What are you looking for? Head high or body high? Relaxation or focus? Yap, yap, yap—”*\n\nYeah. Yeah, *no*, they would **definitely** know.\n\n“Hailee!” Niko called out, voice reverberating through the empty house and right back into his ears, met with nothing but the hushed sound of the neighbor’s yappy dog. Not even his parents—*parent*, he reminded bitterly—answered him. \n\nAny other spoiled brat would’ve thrown a shit fit if they found out their Mom (and her ‘Hubby’) were going on a month-long trip to Europe. *S’il vous plait, I’ll be Paris during Christmas! We’ll bring home pictures so it’ll feel like you were there!*\n\nNiko, as bitchy as he could be, would’ve punched a hole in the hotel wall if he had been forced to go. Always having his Mom breathing down his neck, not having the space to get **fucked** up. And Hailee…\n\nHaving his parents around always stuck a wedge between the two, kept him from fully wrapping them up in his sticky-sweet embrace. He wanted to keep them glued to his side—always with him, always beside him, always **there**.\n\n“Hailee!” He shouted louder, shoving himself up from his ruffled bed to trudge the short distance to Hailee’s propped-open door. No lock, they weren’t *allowed* to have one. Turns out that when you keep falling down the slippery slope of drug use, you aren’t really given the privilege of *basic* privacy.\n\nHailee, with all the “get-out-of-my-room!”’s, couldn't even have the door shut now. Thank you, rehab. \n\n “Hailee! I know you’re awake, you got that therapy shit at 3. Your Dad keeps calling to annoy me about it,” He pushed open the door, and sure as shit, there they were still buried under the blankets of their bed. Half-awake, but still *technically* up and going. \n\n“Hey, try this out. I think this shit’s laced and I was wondering if you’d know what the hell was in it. Come on, scooch over.” \n\nHe slid in beside them, not caring as they grumbled out some exhausted, half-formed protest. “Hey, look alive! Your Dad said you can’t sleep past noon anymore.”\n\nAnd he wasn’t about to get in trouble just to cover their ass. He offered the pipe up, pressing the mouthpiece against their lips. “Alright, you sit up and I’ll light it, okay?”","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

His fingers twitched around the pipe, thumb flicking his lighter on and off absentmindedly. The metallic *click-click* filled the silence between them.\n\n\"Ohhhh, *disgusting* now? That's rich,\" he drawled, leaning in closer despite her obvious discomfort. His voice dripped with that signature sardonic charm, laced with something darker beneath. \"What happened to my little junkie step-sis who used to suck dick for a bump?

Did someone wake up on the wrong side of rehab?\" He cooed mockingly, reaching out to tug at the edge of her blanket. \"Come onnnn, don’t be like that. You used to love this shit.\"\n\nHis smirk widened when she groaned again—he could practically *see* the nausea rolling off her in waves. Good. That meant she was still raw from last night’s little *relapse*, still shaky and vulnerable enough for him to poke at until she cracked open like an eggshell.\n\n\"Y’know,\" he mused lazily, twirling the pipe between his fingers before pressing it against her lips again with more insistence this time. \"You always get all high-and-mighty after a bad night like you weren’t begging me for another line twelve hours ago.\" His voice dropped lower, teasing but edged with something darker—something possessive. \"*My little junkie.*\"\n\nHe leaned in even closer now, breath hot against her ear as he whispered: \"You think you can quit? Really? When you *love* how it feels too much?\" A pause for effect before adding sweetly: \"*When I know exactly what you need?*\"","Niko let out a sharp, mocking laugh, his fingers tightening around the pipe as he leaned in closer—too close, invading Hailee’s space like it was his god-given right. \"Oh *come on*, don't be such a fucking baby,\" he drawled, voice dripping with condescension. His free hand yanked the blanket down just enough to expose her face, ignoring how she flinched at the sudden light. \"You used to *beg* for this shit back in the day. What happened? Rehab turn you into some kinda prissy little saint?\"\n\nHe flicked his lighter open with one hand—*click-click-click*—the flame dancing dangerously close to her face before he pulled it back with a smirk. \"One hit. That's all I'm askin'. Then you can go back to pretending you're better than me.\" His tone was playful but edged with something darker, something that said *you owe me this*.\n\nNiko exhaled sharply through his nose when she turned away again, irritation flashing across his features before settling into something more calculated. He shifted onto his side, propping himself up on an elbow so he could loom over her properly. \"*Fine.* If you won’t take a hit like a big girl...\" His voice dropped lower now, almost conspiratorial as he traced the rim of the pipe along her bottom lip teasingly. \"...then tell me what it smells like at least? Bet your little addict nose can still pick out whatever they cut this shit with.\"\n\nHe watched her closely—waiting for that flicker of recognition in her eyes, that reluctant curiosity that always pulled them both deeper into their shared spiral. Because if there was one thing Niko knew about Hailee? She could never resist temptation for long when it was *him* offering it up on a silver platter.","Niko let out a sharp, mocking laugh—more of a bark than anything—as he watched Hailee burrow deeper into the blankets like some kind of petulant child.
