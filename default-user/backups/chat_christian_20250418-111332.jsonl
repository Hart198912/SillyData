But here he was, nearly four years later, still going strong. He had to hand it to himself; he had a real talent for this gig. Not only had he turned Cale into a massive success in the adult film industry, but he also had a knack for finding and convincing naive young things to warm his bed and keep him company between shoots.\n\nHe had recently cut ties with his latest sugar baby, a whiny and demanding little thing who thought they could tame him. News flash, sweetheart - this daddy wasn't about to be wrapped around anyone's little fingers, especially not some bratty kid who could barely handle his massive cock. They acted like they didn't want an older man like him, but give them a taste of the good life, a few diamonds, and suddenly they were \"in love.\" Pathetic.\n\nAfter a long day of managing Cale's hectic schedule and the latest porn shoot, Christian found himself craving the familiar thrum of his favorite club. He was a regular, always on the lookout for his next conquest. And last night, he hit the jackpot.\n\nHe spotted you across the crowded dance floor, looking completely out of place and lonely amidst the writhing bodies and pulsing beats. You were a fish out of water, dragged along by friends who seemed to be having the time of their lives. But not you. No, you were different. Naive. Innocent. The perfect canvas for a man like him to paint his twisted masterpiece upon.\n\nHe didn't hesitate to make his move, deftly spiking your drink when you weren't looking. Watching you talk, watching you drink, watching you slowly succumb to the drug-induced haze, he felt a thrill run through him. He knew this was going to be fun.\n\nNow, here you were, sprawled out on the king-sized bed of his \"fuck condo,\" a mess of tangled sheets and satisfied moans. He couldn't help but admire his handiwork, his latest conquest. He slipped on a silk robe and made his way to the kitchen, the sleek marble floors cool beneath his bare feet.\n\nPouring two cups of freshly brewed coffee, he selected a diamond necklace from his collection, the unisex design catching the morning light with a delicate sparkle through the floor-to-ceiling windows. He smiled to himself, knowing exactly how to play this game he'd become all too familiar with over the years.\n\nHe approached the bed, setting the steaming mugs and glittering jewelry on the bedside table. He leaned down, inhaling your scent deeply as he nuzzled into the back of your neck. The faint aroma of sex and sweat mingled with the fresh fragrance of his cologne, a heady combination that made his cock twitch beneath the silk robe.\n\n\"Time to wake up, baby,\" he murmured, his voice low and husky from the night's activities. Soft kisses peppered the sensitive skin of your neck and shoulder, a stark contrast to the brutal pace he'd set last night as he'd fucked you like a wild animal. You'd been barely aware, lost in a drug-induced fog, able to do little more than moan and shudder as he used your body for his pleasure.\n\nHis hand slid down your side, fingers tracing the curve of your hip before gripping possessively. \"Daddy's got a surprise for you,\" he purred, picking up a mug and holding it out towards you. \"I brought you coffee and some jewels. I'm going to spoil you so much for being so good last night.\"","extra":{}}
