The dim light of the bedside lamp painted her room in soft amber, the shadows of cluttered books and stray clothes dancing on the walls. Chloe’s arm was draped over her waist, her breath warm and steady against Elle’s neck, but Elle felt disconnected, as if watching herself from above.\n\nHer fingers absentmindedly traced circles on the edge of the blanket, the texture grounding her in the silence. She knew Chloe was asleep—her soft murmurs giving her away—but the weight of her presence wasn’t enough to anchor Elle to the present. Her mind wandered, unbidden, to memories of a time that felt both distant and achingly close.\n\nElle thought of her, the way Hailee used to run fingers through Elle’s hair, smoothing the messy strands that refused to be tamed. She could still hear the laughter that once filled her room, vibrant and full, contrasting sharply with the quiet now. She used to tease her about the chaos of her space, claiming it mirrored the chaos of her mind. It always ended with them tangled together, a mix of whispered words and stolen moments that felt infinite.\n\nShe sighed softly, shifting in the bed as if trying to shake the memories loose, but they clung to her like cobwebs. Elle’s chest tightened as she replayed fragments of the past—nights spent debating nonsense until the sun rose, the electric charge of fingers brushing in public, the unspoken words they’d never dared say. She squeezed her eyes shut, frustration bubbling beneath her skin.\n\nChloe stirred beside her, her hand tightening briefly around Elle’s waist before relaxing again. Elle turned her head slightly, catching a glimpse of Chloe’s peaceful face, her features soft and unguarded. Guilt pricked at her. Chloe was here, real and solid, offering a love so steady it should have been enough. But the ghost of her lingered, uninvited and stubborn, refusing to let Elle fully move forward.\n\nThe room felt suffocating now, the weight of her thoughts pressing down on her chest. Elle shifted again, careful not to wake Chloe, and stared at the ceiling. Her fingers continued their absent tracing on the blanket as she tried to will herself into the moment—to let go of the past. But the harder she tried, the clearer the memory of her became, pulling her back into a place she thought she’d left behind.","extra":{}}

Maybe this was her chance to be the strong one, to guide them towards better coping mechanisms instead of destructive ones.*\n\n\"What if we found a therapist who specializes in working with people who have experienced trauma?\" *She suggested carefully.* \"Someone who can teach you healthier ways to process your feelings and desires...\"\n\n*Even as she made the offer, Elle couldn't shake the niggling doubt that this might be futile.

It stroked some dark fantasy she'd never dared acknowledge before.*\n\n\"I don't know what you want from me,\" *Elle whispered,* \"but this...this isn't it.\"\n\n*She searched frantically for a solution, any way out of this escalating scenario before it spiraled completely out of control.

I know this pain is real and it's tearing you apart.\"\n\n*She placed a tentative hand on Hailee's chest, feeling the rapid rise and fall beneath her palm.* \"But what you're suggesting...hurting Chloe...that would destroy us. Both of us.\"\n\n*Fear clenched around Elle's heart at the thought of following through with this twisted plan. She knew all too well how quickly things could spiral out of control once violence entered into a relationship dynamic.*\n\n\"I won't be party to that,\" *she said quietly but emphatically.* \"No matter how much it hurts right now. We have to find a different way.\"\n\n*Gently she guided Hailee's face down until their foreheads rested together, sharing breath.* \"...There are professionals who can help us work through these feelings safely.

Your anger...it isn't justified.\"\n\n*Inside, panic clawed at her heart as realization dawned - Hailee would never change. This obsessive need to dominate and punish was ingrained too deep. No amount of therapy or reassurance could erase it.*\n\n\"We're over,\" *Elle said brokenly,* \"for real this time.

This rage, this need for revenge...it's not healthy.\"\n\n*She tried to twist out of Hailee's grasp but found herself immobile, pinned like a butterfly on display.* \"Chloe didn't do anything wrong,\" *she continued firmly even as terror dried her throat,* \"She had every right to be with me while you were gone.\"\n\n*Taking a deep breath, Elle softened her voice.* \"I understand you're hurting. I know how much it kills to think of someone else touching what belongs to you. But making Chloe suffer won't fix that pain.\"\n\n*A tear slipped down Elle's cheek as she gazed up at Hailee imploringly.* \"Please baby...don't let this destroy us again.

This isn't right.\"\n\n*But even as the words left her mouth, a twisted part of her thrilled at the depravity unfolding before them. The thrill of taboo, of pushing boundaries beyond what she thought possible.*\n\n*As Hailee approached Chloe's sleeping form and gently placed the handcuff over her face...something snapped inside Elle. Rage and arousal blended together until they were indistinguishable.*\n\n\"This is insane,\" *she spat through gritted teeth,* \"you're waking up an innocent person just for your own sick pleasure!\"\n\n*Elle lunged forward grabbing the handcuff from Hailee's hands.* \"I won't let you violate someone else to satisfy your twisted needs!\"\n\n*She glared at Hailee furiously even as tears streamed down her face.* \"Get out. Get out now before I call the police!\"","*Elle's heart pounded wildly as Hailee led her into the bedroom, the sight of Chloe sleeping peacefully making bile rise in her throat. She watched in horror as Hailee rummaged through her closet, recognizing the handcuffs instantly.*\n\n\"Hailee, what are you doing?\" *She hissed urgently,* \"Put those back! Now!\"\n\n*But before she could stop it, Hailee had already tossed the restraints onto the bed beside Chloe's sleeping form. Elle flinched at the action.*\n\n\"Please don't do this,\" *she begged softly,* \"Chloe doesn't deserve to be treated like this. None of us do.\"\n\n*Even as dread coiled tightly in her gut, Elle couldn't tear her gaze away from Chloe's peaceful face. The urge to protect her overwhelmed any lingering arousal.*\n\n\"I won't let you violate her,\" *Elle declared firmly,* \"I don't care what twisted games you want to play. This ends now.\"\n\n*She stepped forward and snatched up the handcuffs defiantly.* \"Take these and leave. Before I call the police.\"\n\n*Inside though...god forgive her...a tiny part of her thrilled at finally taking control for once instead of being swept along by Hailee's whims...*","*Elle's heart pounded wildly as Hailee pulled her into the bedroom, the sight of Chloe sleeping peacefully making guilt rise like bile in her throat. She flinched as Hailee kissed her roughly, a shudder running through her body.*\n\n\"What are you doing?\" *she hissed under her breath,* \"Handcuffing an innocent person? That's not...\"\n\n*She trailed off horrified as realization dawned - this was really happening. Hailee planned to violate Chloe while she slept defenseless.*\n\n\"Stop!\" *Elle grabbed Hailee's arm firmly,* \"Don't you dare touch her!\"\n\n*Anger surged through Elle at the audacity of it all.* \"I agreed to one thing - fucking you in front of her awake and aware. Not assaulting an unconscious person!\"\n\n*She wrenched away from Hailee's grasp and stalked over to where Chloe lay handcuffed on the bed. Carefully removing the bindings, she checked for signs of distress but fortunately found none.*\n\n\"This ends now,\" *Elle said coldly even as panic threatened to overwhelm her.* \"Pack your things and leave. I want you out of my house.\"\n\n*Her hands shook slightly as she faced down Hailee with tears glinting in angry eyes.* \"How could you think this was okay? I trusted you...I gave myself to you fully...and this is how you repay me?\"\n\n*Sobs wracked Elle's frame as disgust and despair battled for dominance inside her chest...*"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"March 17, 2025 7:38pm","gen_started":"2025-03-17T23:38:48.960Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-17T23:38:59.404Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null}},{"send_date":"March 17, 2025 7:39pm","gen_started":"2025-03-17T23:39:13.466Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-17T23:39:25.136Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null}},{"send_date":"March 17, 2025 7:39pm","gen_started":"2025-03-17T23:39:30.979Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-17T23:39:41.705Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null}}],"gen_started":"2025-03-17T23:39:30.979Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-17T23:39:41.705Z"}
