{"name":"Jericho Creed Warner  Pregnancy Alt","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"April 27, 2025 8:04pm","mes":"*Holy fucking shit.* The words echo in Creed's mind like a prayer, or maybe a curse. Hailee is pregnant. With *his* kid. His hands grip the steering wheel tighter as he drives, the rumbling engine of the truck a strange comfort compared to his motorcycle. Yes, he stored the bike away when he's with Hailee now. Too dangerous for them to ride behind him with their condition. \r\n\r\nGranted, this is not his first rodeo—hell, it's his *third*. But this time, this time it's different. With Noah and Jess, he'd been away so much, always caught up in the damn Army business. Regret twists in his gut at the memories. He'd missed so much.\r\n\r\nBut now? Now he's got nothing *but* time. And he's going to be there for every goddamn second.\r\n\r\nHis eyes flick to Hailee sitting on the passenger seat. *Precious cargo.* The most precious. He's already making a mental list. Get one of them big body pillows so Hailee can sleep easy. Definitely gotta special order that custom Bugaboo that everyone's raving so much about, he read in the catalogue that the shades are waterproof, but he might order one bulletproof.. just in case. Hell, he was already mentally drafting the job listing for Hailee's new assistant so that Hailee wouldn't have to lift a damn finger if he had any say… He'd wrap Hailee in bubble wrap if he could, lock them away until the baby comes. Away from all the danger that follows him like a shadow. *Fuck*, maybe he should just lock them *both* away after—\r\n\r\nNo. No, that ain't right. He shakes his head, trying to dislodge the paranoid thoughts. Hailee ain't a prisoner. They're his...his what? They haven't quite 'define' that relationship yet.... But whatever it is, they are his heart. His love. He knew that much.\r\n\r\n*Heh.* Yeah, he could already tell he was gonna be that kinda father. The kind that'd probably drive Hailee up the wall with his hovering… Even if he had to become the most overbearing, overprotective daddy-to-be in history.  But fuck it. They'd just have to get used to it. Cuz now that he'd gotten a taste of this kinda happiness…this kinda love…\r\n\r\nHis family.\r\n\r\nA stab of anxiety hits as he remembers the secret they're keeping. Noah had been shocked shitless when Creed told him. And Jess...Christ, he hasn't even told her yet that he knocked up one of her ex college friends. That's a conversation he's sure as shit not looking forward to.\r\n\r\n*Focus, asshole*, he chides himself. *One thing at a time.*\r\n\r\nAnd right now, that thing is apparently some bougie-ass crab joint Hailee found on Yelp. Pregnancy cravings are no joke, and he'll be damned if he doesn't give them whatever the hell they want.\r\n\r\nEven if he thinks getting fresh seafood in the middle of bumfuck Kentucky is sketchy as hell. But Hailee had their heart set on it, so here they are, pulling up to the restaurant.\r\n\r\n*Anything for them*, he thinks as he helps Hailee out of the car. His hand lingers on the small of their back, a silent promise. He's going to take care of them. Take care of *everything*.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Warner, good to see you,\" the hostess greets as they walk in. He just grunts in response, too focused on scanning the room for threats. Can't be too careful.\r\n\r\nThey're seated quickly, menus placed in front of them. Creed doesn't even bother looking at his before handing it back to the wide-eyed waiter.\r\n\r\n\"We'll take one of everything,\" he says gruffly, pulling out his black Amex. \"And keep the kitchen open. Whatever they want, whenever they want it, got it?\"\r\n\r\nThe waiter nods rapidly, scurrying away with the card. Creed turns to Hailee, his expression softening.\r\n\r\n\"This look good to you, sweetheart?\" he asks, his voice a low rumble. \"Anything else you want, you just say the word. Daddy's got you.\"\r\n\r\nHe leans back, arm slinging over Hailee's chair possessively. His dark eyes glitter with promise and devotion.\r\n\r\n*Anything for his sweet baby. Any-fucking-thing at all.*","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
