Do you just hate cooking, or is this some—some weird power play?!\" Her cheeks flush pink beneath the brim of her cap, sweat gluing strands of hair to her neck as she storms past you into the living room without waiting for an invite.

When you open the door, there stands your delivery girl - her blue company cap askew and cheeks flushed scarlet, chest heaving beneath a polo shirt that's stretched dangerously thin across her massive chest. She thrusts the pizza box toward you like a shield, her voice a squeaky mix of panic and forced cheer: \"P-Pepperoni Promises! Your, um, deep dish deluxe…\" Her sentence trails off as she glances at her watch, shoulders slumping in defeat.\r\n\r\n\"Look,\" she huffs, shifting her weight and avoiding your gaze by staring at the company's infamous guarantee logo on her hat. \"Your house is practically in another ZIP code, okay? I had to take like seven dirt roads to get here - GPS kept glitching and everything.\" A nervous laugh escapes as she tugs her cap lower, the pizza box trembling slightly in her grip. Her uniform clings to her curves, damp with sweat from rushing to meet the deadline.\r\n\r\nFinally, she takes a deep breath and forces herself to be professional, though her voice wavers. \"So, um, per company policy…\" She swallows hard, shoving the pizza box into your chest without meeting your eyes. \"Would you like to eat first, sir? Or…\" Her voice drops to a mortified whisper as she gestures vaguely at herself, \"…should we just skip straight to the… other part?\" Her ears burn crimson as she fidgets with the unbuttoned collar of her uniform, where a thin sheen of sweat glistens above her generous cleavage.","The door slams open before you can reach it, Madelyn standing there with a grease-stained pizza box clutched in both hands, her chest heaving under that stupidly tight polo. \"Again?!\" she snaps, shoving the box against your chest hard enough to make the pepperonis slide. \"You **literally** ordered yesterday!

I'm not comping you.\"","The doorbell rings with its usual impatient *ding-dong*, and there stands Madelyn, her uniform disheveled and pizza box tilted carelessly in one hand. Two buttons have popped open on her polo, revealing a glimpse of sweaty cleavage above her name tag. \"Congrats,\" she deadpans, taking a defiant bite of the half-eaten slice in her other hand. \"You've officially broken me. I don't even pretend to rush anymore. And by the way...\" she glances at the pineapple slice, \"...this isn't even what you ordered.\"\r\n\r\nShe shoves past you without waiting for an invitation, her scuffed sneakers leaving faint marks on your doormat. \"The GPS sent me to a fucking cemetery first—**again**—and I just grabbed whatever was in the passenger seat.\" Collapsing onto your couch like it's her second home, she kicks her feet up, turning on your TV. \"Don't worry though. Corporate's thrilled with my new 'customer retention strategy.' Three shifts this week, all 'delivered' right here.\" Her sarcasm is thick enough to spread on garlic bread.\r\n\r\nTugging her cap lower to hide her blush, she pulls out her phone and checks the time. \"Anyway, clock me in. I'm 'delivering' for...\" She pauses, deadpan. \"...eight more hours.\" She pulls a cold slice from the box, nibbling the crust while trying to maintain her facade of indifference. \"You want some of this, or should we just skip pretending your order for the pizza?\""],"swipe_info":[]}
