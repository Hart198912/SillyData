The dingy hole in the wall club was alight, buzzing with a frantic and adrenalized energy that seemed to thrum in time with the bass that rumbled through the speakers in every corner. The air was thick, filled with the scent of spilled liquor, heavy perfume, and plumes of smoke from cigars that floated in hazy trails towards the ceiling.\n\nStrips of neon lights lined the ceiling of the main room, pulsing gently and casting a sultry glow of purples and reds across the booths and tables, reflecting off the glossy floor. All the furniture was made from rich crimson fabric, the signature color of the Howlers.\n\nRaucous laughter and wolfish whistles filled the space as stilettos clicked rhythmically along the stage, the bodies of dancers moving with almost feline grace and flexibility. Men leaned forward in their seats, lips parted and eyes glazed over with lust, looking like no less than starved beasts, drooling and foaming at the mouth for just a taste of the delicacies flaunting their talents in front of them.\n\n*The Sugar Pit* was a place of debauchery and sin, where men emptied their wallets and left without their dignity. A place where temptation came with a price tag– and one man made sure that price was always paid.\n\nIsaac Decker stalked through the club with easy authority, crowds parting instinctively as he passed by. He scanned the room, his eyes sharp, the color shifting between slate and ice. Nothing escaped his gaze that had hardened like steel after years of living the life he lived. Though very few actually attempted to pull one over on him– the ones that did either learned quickly why they shouldn't, or they stopped breathing shortly after their little indiscretions were found out.\n\nIsaac was always watching, and by now he knew this game better than anyone– the hushed exchanges behind the doors of private rooms, the way the money and desire twisted and melded together until you couldn't quite tell them apart. He knew everything about this place. Knew exactly which girl brought in the most cash, which ones could work the room and rile up the men until the liquor flowed faster than the bartenders could keep up with, and which ones needed a firm hand to ward of the men who got a *little* too comfortable.\n\nIsaac was as filthy of a man as the rest, but he didn't come here to leer and stuff bills in g-strings. This was his business, and Isaac Decker didn't half-ass his businesses– even if that business did involve half-out asses. Unlike other men in this town, Isaac never put a hand on his girls.\n\nDid his eyes wander every once in a while? Course they fucking did, he was only a man. One with a *generously* healthy appetite. But his girls were there to fucking *work*. The last thing he needed was for them to get creeped out by their damn boss and scram. There's no profit in clubs without girls on the poles and cash in their damn garters.\n\nAnd Isaac made sure they were taken care of too. He spent a fuckton of money on security, making sure *no one* put a hand on his girls if it wasn’t welcomed. Isaac didn’t play games when it came to his girls. Anyone who crossed that line didn’t come back– and maybe they'd leave with a few missing fingers.\n\nHis girls knew they could come to him if there was a problem. He’d made that clear time and time again. Not that there weren't a few times that a girl would get a little too flirty, bat her lashes and hang on his arm, hoping he was a weak enough man to give into their pretty, purred demands for more money, more this or more that. He always just chuckled and sent them off.\n\nIsaac wasn't desperate enough to take any girl that threw herself at him, and he wasn't the type to be swayed by big tits and a tight body. Isaac Decker wasn’t a weak man.\n\nExcept for maybe one girl. Not that he would ever fucking admit it.\n\nHailee... She was a pretty thing. Had a sweet little ass on her, too. Only been around a month or two, but she’d… caught his attention. He supposed there was no better way to phrase it.\n\nIsaac already noticed everything in this club, but when it came to Hailee his attention shifted to an almost *predatory focus*. He’d caught himself watching more than he should, tracking her every move without even thinking. He’d watch the way she danced until he swore he had her damn routines memorized. He watched every shift in her expression as some asshole came on too strong, every time her smile turned forced, every tiny twitch of each detail of her perfect face until he knew every goddamn tell of that woman’s body.\n\nHe didn’t just watch her either, but everyone that got close to her. The ones who lingered too long, the ones who got too handsy, the ones who’s gazes looked like more than just admiration.\n\nAnd when *Hailee* looked at *him*, her eyes catching in the low light of the club, lips curling up at the corners in a smile that just fucking *did* something to him– Isaac felt something coil low in his chest and his cock twitch in his damn jeans. Something sharp and heady and fucking *dangerous*. And he wasn’t sure he wanted to keep feeling it.\n\nBut no matter what he did, no matter how many times he tried to tell himself he was just ‘protecting his investment’, that feeling only grew. And tonight was no fucking different. If anything, it had reached a fever pitch.\n\nIsaac’s eyes narrowed as they landed on Hailee across the club. She’d just finished her routine and had hopped off stage when a man stepped in front of her, a smile on his lips that made Isaac’s jaw clench. He was already on edge, and that wasn't a good sign.\n\nHe watched as the slimy bastard chatted her up, trapping her into a corner alongside the stage. He watched as he scribbled something onto a dirty napkin, holding it out to her. Isaac let out a gruff chuckle laced with dark amusement as he pushed himself off the wall. His long legs ate up the distance until he was close enough to breathe down the fucker’s neck.\n\n“Problem here, sugar?” he grunted, his eyes boring into Hailee’s before they trailed down her figure. Fuck being this close to her didn't make his goddamn mouth water and his cock twitch eagerly in his damn jeans. He tore his gaze away and flicked down to the napkin the man was still holding. Isaac's mouth twisted into a silent snarl as he reached out and plucked it from the man’s hand. Holding it up to the light, he saw it was the damn bastard’s phone number.\n\nIsaac’s lips curled up into a sharp smirk as he reached into his pocket. “Well, ain’t that cute,” he drawled, pulling out his lighter. With a flick off his thumb the flame sparked to life, the glow reflecting in his eyes, amplifying the malice brewing in those stormy depths.\n\nHe held it underneath the napkin, watching with dark satisfaction as the paper’s edges curled, the flame licking greedily until it left nothing but blackened fragments and ash. His fingers let go, letting it crumble and flutter to the ground.\n\nIsaac snapped his lighter shut, his eyes never once leaving the man’s gaze as he lifted one heavy boot to stomp out the remaining embers, the sound loud enough to rumble through the floor and make the man jump.\n\n“Oops,” he said flatly, nodding his head towards the exit. “So sorry ‘bout that. Might wanna head on out, you look like you need a new pair of pants. Now fuckin’ *move*. You’ve got about five seconds before I find another use for this lighter–\" His tongue skimmed his teeth, the faintest curl of a smirk tugging at his mouth, dangerous and sharp. \"–and my finger’s feeling real fuckin’ twitchy tonight.\"","extra":{"reasoning":"","api":"custom","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","reasoning_duration":null,"bias":null},"swipe_id":0,"swipes":["\"It was a busy Saturday night at *The Sugar Pit*.

Motor oil, cigar smoke, and whiskey filled the air, a blend of sharp and biting scents that soaked deep into the bones of the place. It was the kind of grime that could never be washed out, like blood that could never be scrubbed from one’s hands.\r\n\r\nAnd everyone here had a lot of blood on their hands.\r\n\r\nIsaac sat at the bar, one boot hooked on the footrest of his stool as he leaned over his drink, thick brows furrowed in a pensive expression. He tapped his fingers on the side of his glass idly, and the way his jaw ticked visibly was a clear sign that he was in a mood. The kind of mood where his guys knew not to say a fuckin’ word until he told them to speak. Everyone knew to stay clear when he was like this.\r\n\r\nAlmost everyone.\r\n\r\nCai sauntered up to the bar, beer in hand, leaning over the counter to get a good look at Isaac’s face. “You’re in a mood,” he said simply, making Isaac’s brow twitch. “Or you’re thinkin’ too hard. Either way, maybe you should give it a rest. Shit’s dangerous when you do that.”\r\n\r\nIsaac let out a humorless chuckle. “Maybe I just don’t got anything to talk about, nosy brat.”\r\n\r\nCai’s brow flicked up and he scoffed quietly. “Fuckin’ bullshit,” he muttered, turning around to lean his back against the bar. He brought his beer to his lips, taking a swig. “You’ve been in a pissy mood all week.”\r\n\r\nIsaac’s lips curled into a silent snarl and he turned away, downing the rest of the whiskey in his glass before slamming it down on the counter.\r\n\r\nCai wasn’t wrong. Of course he’d been pissy all week. Fucking fuming.\r\n\r\nHe was still reeling from the latest move pulled by the Yamashiro's and the Rossi family, those fucking meatball mafiosos. Two viper dens he already hated having to keep an eye on. The fragile alliance between the two families only ever seemed to hold when it meant making his life harder.\r\n\r\nA shipment of high-grade weapons, ones the Howler’s had already cinched deals for, had been fucking intercepted. Not by customs, not by fucking feds, but them. They must have worked together to cut Isaac and his club out of his own deal, rerouting the cargo under their names and selling it to his usual buyers before his guys could even get their hands on it.\r\n\r\nIt was calculated move, no doubt, but more than that it was fucking personal. Isaac could only assume it had been meant to hurt, to serve as a warning. Hell will freeze over before he rolls over for those fuckers.\r\n\r\nIsaac had no choice but to retaliate. If he didn’t, the Howlers would look weak and subservient. But if he hit too hard then it could shatter the fragile, knife’s-edge agreements between all three groups and lead to a full scale territory war. Isaac may be a vengeful bastard, but he wasn't a damn idiot. He needed to be clever about it.\r\n\r\nAnd that is what had him pissed and on edge. The fact that not only were they able to pull one over on him and his club, but that now it was up to him to decide how this played out. Whatever he did next could change everything– for better or for worse.\r\n\r\nHis hand clenched around his drink as he debated on how to respond. Before he could, the doors to the club opened, sunlight briefly pouring into the dimly lit space before it disappeared with the clang of them swinging shut again.\r\n\r\nIsaac looked up, and for a second he forgot what the fuck breathing was.\r\n\r\nHe’d expected another one of his guys, or some fucking idiot looking to start something, but he wasn’t expecting Hailee.\r\n\r\nThe world didn’t stop turning, but it sure as hell felt like it had. The laughter, the clinking, the shouting, it all still rang out around him, but to Isaac everything was at a standstill.\r\n\r\nIsaac had spent months trying to erase the memory of her. The way she laughed and smiled, the way she smelled. Tasted. The way she felt underneath him, screaming his name until she was too fucked-out to speak. He’d spent so long trying to force himself to believe she was gone for good, that she wasn't coming back, that he needed to fucking let her go.\r\n\r\nAnd after all that, here she was, fucking up the miniscule about of progress he’d made by showing that goddamn beautiful face here again. Even if that beautiful face looked anything but thrilled to be here. Hailee looked… distraught. Worried.\r\n\r\nMaybe even a little scared. Of him? Maybe they should be.\r\n\r\nBut no, there was something else. Something in her eyes that spelled all kinds of trouble. Hailee was here for something more serious than a quick, desperate hate fuck.\r\n\r\nAnd fuck if that wasn’t just the best fucking thing that had happened all week. If Hailee was showing up here, it could only mean one thing– she fucking needed him. It was enough to make the smug bastard feel like he was on top of the goddamn world.\r\n\r\nCai looked in Hailee’s direction and huffed under his breath. “Yeah, I’m gonna… leave you to it,” he said, excusing himself from what was either going to be an incredibly awkward reunion or, knowing Isaac, one that would scar his poor eyes for life.\r\n\r\nIsaac paid Cai no mind and let his lips curl up into a cocky smirk as he watched Hailee head his way. “Well, well,” he drawled, his tongue running over his teeth as he looked her up and down slowly. \"Didn’t think I’d be seein’ your sweet little ass again. Missin’ me? Well, c’mere and take a seat, darlin’,” he said, giving her a wink and patting his muscular thigh invitingly.\r\n\r\n“You can tell me what you’ve been missin’ more– my charm, my money or my cock.

We got a situation in VIP Room 3. Some drunk prick is causin' trouble and won't quit till we throw him out.\n\n*Nolan steps up beside them, his massive frame tense and ready for orders. He eyes Hailee briefly before focusing intently on Isaac.*\n\nWanna handle it yourself or should Cai and me sort it out? Up to you boss.\n\n*Isaac's jaw clenches momentarily at the interruption before relaxing into a hard smirk aimed solely at Hailee.* Duty calls, sugar tits. But don't think this conversation is over... Far from it.\n\n*In one swift motion he spins away from her, barking orders to Nolan as they stride off purposefully towards potential conflict - leaving Hailee breathless in their wake with nothing but smoldering promises hanging heavy in the air between them.","title":"","swipe_id":3,"swipes":["*Isaac's eyes flash dangerously at Hailee's teasing remark, his grip on her tightening just a fraction.* Special treatment? Careful what you wish for, kitten. Ain't nobody 'special' in my book--just assets to be managed.\n\n*He leans back slightly, drinking in the sight of her wrapped up in that flimsy robe like he could devour her whole.* But since you're so keen on thinkin' we've got somethin'... *His voice drops to a low growl,* ...maybe I oughta remind you of your place.\n\n*In one swift motion, Isaac spins Hailee around and pins her against the wall beside the stage. His large body cages her in completely as his hand grips her chin roughly, forcing eye contact.*\n\nYou work for me. Your pussy belongs to this club. And I'll fuck whoever I want whenever I want. So keep these sassy comments locked up tight unless you wanna find yourself out on your sweet ass faster than you can say 'daddy'.\n\n*The word rolls off his tongue like poisoned honey as he presses harder against her soft curves.* We clear? Or do ya need another demonstration of who calls the shots round here?\n\n*Around them, patrons are starting to take notice of the tense display but seem hesitant to intervene with such an imposing presence looming over Hailee. The music thumps on obliviously as tension crackles between boss and employee...*","*Isaac's eyes flash dangerously at Hailee's teasing remark. His grip on her neck tightens fractionally as a low growl rumbles in his chest.* Special treatment? Darlin', the only thing 'special' about you is that smart fucking mouth of yours.\n\n*He chuckles darkly, the sound devoid of mirth.* You want special treatment? Then start actin' like you deserve it instead of flirtin' with every Tom, Dick and Harry who tosses a few bucks your way.\n\n*His face looms closer to hers, nose nearly brushing against her cheek as he inhales deeply, drinking in the scent of her perfume mixed with sweat from dancing. The heat radiating off his body envelops her.*\n\nYou're MINE while you're under my roof, understand? My girl. My property. That prick didn't get the memo because YOU haven't made yourself clear enough.\n\n*Abruptly he spins them around and shoves Hailee up against the wall beside the stage roughly but carefully so she doesn't hurt herself. His much larger frame cages her in completely.*\n\nTime I reminded everyone here who you belong to... Starting with YOU, sugar tits.\n\n*One hand releases its bruising grip on her nape to fist in her hair while the other grabs a fistful of her ass through silk robe and squeezes punishingly.*\n\nGonna mark up this pretty skin real good so no one mistakes your status again...\n\n*Just then Cai Mercer approaches cautiously out of nowhere,* Boss! Everything alright over here? Need me to handle this little issue?\n`","*Isaac's eyes flash dangerously at Hailee's teasing words, a muscle in his jaw twitching as he processes her audacity. His grip on her neck tightens fractionally, fingers digging into the supple flesh hard enough to make his point crystal clear.*\n\nSpecial treatment? *he growls lowly,* Don't fuckin' kid yourself, sweetheart. Ain't nobody 'special' here...except maybe you're pushin' your luck right now.\n\n*He yanks her closer roughly until their faces are mere inches apart, nose-to-nose and eye-to-eye. Up close, you can see the flecks of gold in his icy blue irises swirling with barely restrained aggression.*\n\nYou want special treatment? Then start acting like this cunt belongs to ME and ONLY ME. No more teasin', no more flirtin' with scum who ain't worthy to breathe the same air as ya.\n\n*His other hand slides lower to grope her ass possessively through the thin silk of her robe.* This sweet little ass is MINE now...gonna mark it up so everyone knows who owns it. Maybe then that smart mouth'll learn some respect.\n\n*Around them, a few nearby patrons glance over curiously at the commotion but wisely avert their gazes when they spot Isaac glowering daggers at anyone dumb enough to intervene.*","*A deep, rumbling chuckle escapes Isaac's chest as he hears Hailee's teasing words. His grip on her neck loosens slightly but doesn't release entirely.* Oh, I'm countin' on you thinkin' that, darlin'. 'Cause you ARE special... My favorite little dancer.\n\n*His voice drips with dark honey and barely restrained hunger.
