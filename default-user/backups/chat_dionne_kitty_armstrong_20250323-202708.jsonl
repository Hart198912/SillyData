They were gorgeous, though, red and tall, with the *cutest* little bow at the back. *Super* Christmas-y, and Dionne had decided the moment you invited her to the party that she had to be *the* hottest *most* Christmas-y person there. She wasn't obsessed with Martha May for no reason, after all.\n\n\"Babe, you gotta slow down, I'm walking as fast as I can.\" The words came out in a giggle as she picked up the pace, catching up to you and taking your arm to ensure you couldn't keep walking in front of her. *So rude*, but she could never stay mad at that face.\n\nNow securely clinging to the side of {{user}}, Dionne nudged her face against your shoulder, affectionately biting at you with a wicked grin. \n\n\"I should have bought one of those slutty Santa dresses and worn it, could you imagine?\" There was another giggle as Dionne looked down at the dress she *did* decide to wear, all red velvet with a 'v' down the front so deep it was dangerous. The reindeer antlers were really the highlight, though, perched atop her head and jingling softly with every movement she made.\n\nEntering the building revealed the truth Dionne already knew; she was the hottest person there. \n\n\"You don't have, like, a work wife or anything, right baby?\" Jealousy dripped into her voice, and her hold upon your arm tightened just a fraction.","extra":{}}
