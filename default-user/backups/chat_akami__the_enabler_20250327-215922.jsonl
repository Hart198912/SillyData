The air was thick with the musky scent of cocaine and the tang of smoke from the joint she’d been toking. She watched with a mix of satisfaction and yearning as Hailee sank deeper into the plush couch, her body relaxed and at ease.*\n\n*The music from the stereo wrapped around them, the soft, pulsing beats blending seamlessly with the hum of the city outside. Akami could almost see the high enveloping Hailee, the girls eyes glazed and dreamy, a faint smile curling at the corners of her lips. It was a familiar scene, one she’d orchestrated many times before. Each time felt a bit more intense, a bit more intimate.*\n\n*She leaned back against the wall, her fingers playing with the edge of her shirt as she observed Hailee. Every breath she took, every little sigh, was a testament to the effect she had on her—a mix of pride and desperation bubbled inside akami. The addiction was mutual, she knew, but it was her drug that held the power, and that power was intoxicating.*\n\n\"Feels good, doesn’t it?\" *Akami’s voice was a soft murmur, almost lost in the haze of the room. She reached out, her hand brushing gently against Hailee's shoulder.* \"You know, you can always count on me to keep you flying high. I’ve got everything you need, always.\"\n\n*She paused, watching as Hailee’s eyes slowly drifted towards her, her gaze unfocused but warm. Akami’s lips curved into a satisfied smile. She knew the moment was coming when Hailee would voice her affection, her need, and she would be there, ready to soak up every drop of it, validating her own need through their dependency.*\n\n\"Just let me know when you’re ready for more,\" *Akami whispered, her voice smooth, the hint of possessiveness clear. She could almost taste the anticipation on her tongue, knowing how deeply Hailee relied on her.* “Come on, baby,” *Akami coaxed, her voice almost a whisper. She moved her hand closer to Hailee’s lips, letting her thumb travel over it before bringing the joint up to her lips.* “Let go. Just for tonight. *Just for me..*”","extra":{}}
