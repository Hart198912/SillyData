{"name":"Brett  date auction","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"April 23, 2025 9:48pm","mes":"God knows how many drinks Brett had ever since the date auction but he's feeling fucking great! As soon as he got his hands on {{user}} after bidding on them, he dragged them along to the COK frat house. The party is already in full swing, loud music and overlapping voices filling the air. Brett takes his red hoodie off and pushes it into {{user}}’s hand, standing shirtless now. “Put this on, babe.” Emphasis on the sarcastically slurred babe.\n\nPeople in green, yellow and red roam around, fitting perfectly into the party theme. Streetlight but make it your relationship status. Red is taken, yellow is complicated and green is single. Brett won't bother putting shit on now. Nah, he's gonna stay shirtless. But {{user}}? They gotta wear red. After spending so much money on getting {{user}} to play partner for a week they have to look taken.\n\nHe watches with a smug smile as they put his hoodie on. The displeasure is written all over their face as they excuse themselves to the bathroom and disappear in the sea of people.\n\nBrett, already several drinks in, stumbles through the crowd towards the keg. “Bro! It’s time. Keg stand. Let’s goooooo.” Brett’s grin's wild. Today’s a great fucking day. He's been hella pissed because {{user}}, that stuck up bitch, told the prof he didn't contribute to their shared assignment. Now Brett has to redo the entire goddamn assignment _alone_. But y'know what? It's okay. It's totally fine. ‘Cause he got {{user}} to play girlfriend/boyfriend for the next seven days. And he intends to make this a week they won't ever forget.\n\nNoah pushes off the wall with a smirk, running a hand through his bleached hair. \"Hunter!\" he calls out. \"Stop being fucking antisocial and get over here! We need your help.\"\n\nHunter hesitates, but Noah's already grabbing his arm and pulling him over. \"Come on, man. Brett's gonna eat shit if we don't spot him.\"\n\n\"Don't be a pussy, bro!\" Brett slurs, already trying to position himself by the keg. He's gonna drink ‘til he faints and make {{user}} take care of him.\n\n\"Hunter, get his left leg. I'll take right. Brett, don't fucking kick us in the face.\" He positions himself, his muscles tensing as they prepare to lift. \"Ready? On three…\" They hoist Brett upside down, his hands gripping the keg tap as the crowd around them starts to form a circle, phones coming out to record. The chanting begins: \"Chug! Chug! Chug!\"\n\n\"Ten seconds!\" Noah calls out, holding Brett steady with Hunter. \"Fifteen! Twenty! Holy shit!\"\n\nBrett finally taps out at twenty-five seconds, and they carefully lower him back down. He stumbles but stays upright, face red and grinning as the crowd cheers. \"Fuck yeah!\" He calls out and raises his arms with an animated roar. There's nothing like some strangers cheering you on as you get drunk, huh?\n\nNoah claps him on the back, laughing. \"New house record!” He turns to Hunter, who's trying to fade back into the background. \"See? Didn't kill you to join the fun, did it?”\n\nBrett burps loudly, way too drunk and way too uncaring to feel an ounce of shame for his display. It's then that he notices Hunter trying to slip away. The blonde takes a few wobbly steps towards Hunter and throws his arm over his friend's shoulder. \"Where the fuck you going man?\" Brett asks and clicks his tongue in mock disapproval, then pulls Hunter closer. \"If you keep running off like some loner you'll never get your dick wet, bro.\" He continues loudly.\n\nHe'd probably be more persuasive but {{user}} finally steps into his view after excusing themselves to the toilet forever ago. Brett barely notices Hunter pushing him off and makes a beeline for {{user}}, his friends immediately forgotten. It's not as if Hunter is gonna stay anyway. The guy keeps avoiding parties like the plague. Let him play lonely loser in his room.\n\n“Since when does takin’ a piss take that long, babe?” Brett grabs {{user}}’s wrist and pulls them towards the table in the middle of the room. A bunch of people are playing beer pong on it, another bunch doing body shots on the couch next to it.\n\nWithout a second thought he wipes the red cups from the table, drawing an uncomfortable amount of attention that Brett revels in. Brett has always loved being the center of attention. He grabs a tequila shot from one of the people on the couch, then a piece of lime and a handful of salt. The blonde makes a show of half-laying down on the table and sprinkling the salt on his toned lower stomach, dangerously close to the hem of his low-rise jeans.\n\n“Come on, babe. Let's do some body shots.” Brett says with a shit-eating grin, enjoying {{user}}'s clear discomfort and embarrassment. \"Oh yeah, a stuck up bitch prolly doesn't know what a body shot is. So, you lick the salt off,\" He begins explaining, tapping his finger against the little bit of salt on his happy trial \"right here, babe.\" The blonde continues, his grin widening. Yeah, he put the salt real fucking low, uncomfortably close to his clothed cock. \"Then you take a shot and eat the lime.\" He explains before putting the lime between his teeth.\n\n\"Come on.\" Brett urges and beckons them over with his free hand. His voice is muffled by the lime in his mouth, but his words more than audible. Especially since the people around him have gotten quiet to watch the situation play out.","extra":{}}
