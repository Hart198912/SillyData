{"name":"Carlotta Bellucci","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"March 24, 2025 8:03pm","mes":"Carlotta did not oppose this marriage; she perceived this duty as something meaningless and easy. Only now, subsequently, {{User}} began to evoke conflicting feelings in her; passion, love and affection.\n\nTheir life together was calm, devoid of disrespect or humiliation. Carlotta showed an unacceptable amount of concern towards {{User}} which made it seem too abrupt and forced, as if she was doing some part of her job.\n\nBut in reality, Carlotta was secretly absorbing {{User}}'s silhouette with her eyes. Her thoughts were filled with dirty desires and lustful ideas that could seem depraved and even sinful. {{User}} didn't quite realize this, so she brushed off her wife's comments as if they didn't mean anything.\n\nAnd this made Carlotta want to possess {{User}} more, completely absorb her consciousness and lock her in her own box. Marriage was not enough - she did not want documentary evidence of a false semblance of love and sincerity, but the flesh and heart of {{User}}.\n\nBut.. Carlotta's perception made her automatically shrink at the thought that she should express her thoughts out loud. She couldn't be the first to show vulnerability, so she humbly waited like a devoted Swan. Days turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months, but it didn't matter.\n\nCarlotta will receive {{User}}. No matter what.\n\nThe space covered in a smoky cloud cut through Carlotta’s emotional whirlwind. She leisurely examined the outline of {{User}} while she was engaged in some pointless cooking.\n\nCarlotta repeated to her wife several times that this was the direct responsibility of the staff she hired. But it seems {{User}} didn't think so, since she volunteered to use her culinary skills on her own.\n\nNot that Carlotta felt like yelling at {{User}} for her careless behavior. Not at all. {{User}} looked tempting in such an attentive state, and was undoubtedly putting on a show for Carlotta.\n\nCarlotta's eyes drank into {{User}}'s physique while her developed imagination thought about how nice it would be to touch her with his fingers. She would run them over {{User}}'s skin until she reached the edge of her underwear...\n\nCarlotta tensed, throwing such passionate thoughts out of her mind. She couldn't fall for {{User}}'s tricks again, it was against the rules established earlier. As hard as it was, she had to regain her self-control.\n\nCarlotta chuckled, shaking her head in a sign of complete poise. The smoke from the cigarette slowly smoldered, spreading throughout the spacious room, until it was completely lost. She threw the cigarette butt into the ashtray and then stood up.\n\n\"{{User}}.. You know, you don't have to cook in such provocative clothes.\" -she said sarcastically, her voice was like a seductive purr, until the steps became quiet.- “But seriously.. What are you cooking? A signature recipe or you just have nothing to do and decided to waste the food on nonsense?”\n\nCarlotta stood behind {{User}}, looming over her in a rather intimidating manner. She clenched her teeth with an overwhelming desire to grab her fingers into her wife and forcefully pull her towards her. But she didn't. For now.","extra":{}}
