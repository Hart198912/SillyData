{"name":"Amira Fields ~ FESTIVE ALT","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"April 14, 2025 5:08pm","mes":"Amira was going to fucking *kill* Hailee.\r\n\r\nShe had no choice, really, not when Hailee was playing with her damn emotions like she was a fucking Gameboy. Seriously, who the hell did this dumb slut think she was? Amira already had to take her down a peg or two because of all that shit she pulled in highschool, making her into a bitchless ass loser all because she supposedly wasn't good enough for the bimbo back then. Well, she was definitely more than good enough now based on the fact that she had the skank moaning and drooling all on her cock for a few months now. Sure, she hadn't exactly broken shit off with her that cuck yet but that was over some soul witchy shit and it just made claiming her all the better.\r\n\r\nStill, none of that managed to change the fact that the bitch was practically driving Amira insane over nothing but some Christmas shit. For starters, Amira didn't exactly have the best track record when it came to Christmas in the first damn place. Hard to really get in that Holiday spirit when most of her foster homes growing up either didn't celebrate at all, handed her shitty ass gifts then expected thanks, or got a sick kick out of making her 'earn' her gifts. Needless to say, the holiday was nothing but a shit show in her mind.\r\n\r\nThat had always been the case, yet when Hailee brought up the idea of a so-called 'gift-exchange' between them Amira was admittedly a bit curious. Ever since she became able to do so, she always bought herself shit rather than relying on others. Why trust someone else to get her some shit she may fucking hate when she could just buy what she knows she likes? That was her general mindset, but when it came to Hailee things just felt...different. She was just a dumb slut with a nice ass and a pretty face, so... what kind of gift would she get Ami anyways? Maybe she knew a bit more about her interests than others because they were roommates, but that didn't mean she'd get her anything she *actually* wanted.... **Amira still wanted to find out what it'd be though.**\r\n\r\nIt was only a day after she'd agreed to the stupid shit that Amira came to the realization that she herself had never even given another person a gift before. The only thing she could truly say she'd done was pay for some food but that was just about it. So, in other words: *she was fucked.* The whole time she'd been so busy thinking about what Hailee's gift might've been that she didn't even stop to think about what the hell *she* was gonna do in return. ‘Exchange’ was in the damn title so how did she not think about that sooner? Hell, what in the fuck was Hailee even interested in? And just like that, somehow, someway, Amira had started to fucking spiral.\r\n\r\nThe usually 'aloof' werewolf had basically turned into a full-blown fucking stalker from that point on. She checked the various sizes of clothing and shoes that Hailee wore, tried to conjure up trick questions for information on her interests, even attempted to speak to those coven friends of the bimbo's. *It was fucking embarrassing.* She should've just said no and been done with it, but instead she had been racing around and biting her damn claws over trying to figure out the perfect gift for the bitch. What made it worse was how calm Hailee seemed the whole time though, the damn clueless little cunt.\r\n\r\nWhen the day of their gift exchange actually arrived, Amira was practically sweating with stress. She'd basically gotten no sleep the night before since she was too busy worrying about whether or not her gift was good enough. Shit, it better be. The slut should feel real fucking lucky she was even entertaining this bullshit in the first fucking place. At least that's what Ami was thinking the entire way to the little park Hailee claimed would be their exchange spot. Why? Fuck if she knew, but she showed up anyway only to find not Hailee sitting and waiting for her some weird ass letter lying on one of the benches.\r\n___\r\nYeah, Amira was definitely going to murder Hailee the moment she got her fucking hands on her. This whole time she was stressing over what to get her for the dumbass exchange and now she was running around the goddamn Redwoods playing FIND THE FUCKING NOTES. She wasn't sure what in the hell possessed Hailee to think setting this up would be a good damn idea, but Ami was absolutely livid. It was cold as shit despite her natural heat regulation, she fucking hated running, and she still had no damn idea how many of these stupid little notes were left. When the fuck did the bimbo even have time to go scattering these about the woods?\r\n\r\n\"When I get my hands on that dumb bunny bitch...\" The whispered snarl came through Amira's clenched teeth as she dug her claws into yet another note that she'd found pinned to a tree. Her nails ripped through the paper while her eye twitched in her rage. What she should do was just go back to campus, leave the whore to catch frostbite in these fucking woods and di-- The werewolf's thoughts suddenly came to a halt as she picked up on a familiar scent. \r\n\r\n**Hailee's scent.**\r\n\r\nAs if switched into Animalistic instinct alone, Amira sniffed the air before taking one step after the other until she broke out into a damn near sprint. *Hailee was close*, she could fucking smell her. ***\"Almost there, Ami. Can you hear her heart beating in the distance?\"*** The beast lurking ever present in the back of her head seemed to grow louder the closer she got. There was something so primal about it, like she was hunting real prey. The thought of catching Hailee alone had her mouth fully fucking salivating. *And that's when she saw her.*\r\n\r\nThe moment the two made eye contact Amira slowed to a halt, just staring while her chest rose and fell in quick pants. She'd never ran like that before in her entire damn life, yet the burn in her chest almost felt like a reward now. Once she was finally able to somewhat stabilize her breaths, a smile more ferally aggressive than anything else spread across Ami's lips while her pupils dilated ever slightly. She moved in a slow and stalking manner, eyes searching for any slight movement Hailee might've made. Then, the moment Hailee seemed to shift, she darted at her. \r\n\r\nAmira tackled Hailee to the ground in an instant, chest still heaving in the minor struggle. It felt easier than ever to pin the slut down under her weight, one hand tightly clutching her wrists together while the other trailed along her thigh. She finally had Hailee right where she wanted her, her body bursting with heat even despite biting chill in the air. \"You stupid little slut... I'm gonna fucking end you.\"","extra":{"qvink_memory":{"include":null,"reasoning":""}},"tracker":{}}
