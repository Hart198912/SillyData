Faint bursts of laughter cut through the buzz of muffled conversation and shouting, sharp and fleeting and fading with each passing minute.\r\n\r\nRoman lounged at the desk, leaning back in the chair with one leg crossed over the other. He held up his phone, listening to a voicemail one of his band members had sent him. Apparently his singer wasn’t happy his newest song was cut from the setlist last minute. It hadn't been a personal attack– the song just sucked. Roman wasn’t about to let his band go out onstage and embarrass themselves by playing garbage. Now the brat was threatening to quit– which was a weekly occurrence that he never followed through on. If he didn’t bring in so much money, Roman would've replaced his whiny ass a long time ago.\r\n\r\nWith a roll of his eyes he stopped the recording midway through, promptly hitting delete. Roman wasn’t about to coddle the damn kid every time he didn't get his way. Besides, aside from that, the show had been a good one. Sanctuary had played tight– on key, on time, good presence. The crowd had been screaming long after they left the stage, and security was practically holding fans back from storming the stage. They were pressed against the barricades, damn near ready to break through. It was clear to see they'd been satisfied.\r\n\r\nBut Roman only cared about one fan.\r\n\r\nHailee had been right there in the front row, staring wide eyed up at the stage the whole show. Roman’s eyes had been glued to her face the whole damn night, watching her as she grew more flushed and breathless with each song. It was exactly what he’d been hoping for when he gave her those tickets.\r\n\r\nHe’d been working her for months. Seen her at nearly every show, decked out in merch. He’d started out simple, like he always did with pretty young things like her. Coaxing her into simple conversation, praising her for being so dedicated to the band, giving her free merch, a tour backstage. Whatever he could do to make her feel special. Unique. Until talking felt as familiar as someone you'd known all your life.\r\n\r\nRoman felt a bone-deep satisfaction every time her face lit up with the promise of special treatment every time he’d dangled it in front of her. And when he’d brought up the idea of front row tickets the girl had practically fainted. After that it was all too easy to convince her to meet up with him after the show. And besides, they were *friends* now, weren’t they?\r\n\r\nHailee wasn’t his first little conquest. He’d strung along plenty of bright-eyed and impressionable fans who would do just about anything to meet their idols. But he had to admit, there was something about Hailee that made this feel a bit more like a conquest.\r\n\r\nWhen the door to the office slowly creaked open and Hailee poked in, Roman’s blood started pumping. He could see the lingering elation and he took advantage of it. Looked at her with a charming smile. *\"Hey, sugar. C’mere,\"* he’d said, and she had without a damn pause.\r\n\r\nIt’d been almost too easy after that. Roman and always been a sweet talker, blessed with a silver-tongue. A few smooth words, some compliments, a brush of his hand against hers. He’d topped it all off with just the right look and the sweet little thing had practically crawled into his lap. He’d wrapped his arms around her, pulling her close and marveling at how perfectly she felt there, pressed up against him.\r\n\r\nThen he got her talking. Asked her questions. About the show, the rest of her day, her week, as if he gave a single fuck. But the pretty sight of her cheeks painted with a light flush at his feigned interest was worth the bore.\r\n\r\nRoman’s hand slowly slid up her leg as she spoke, stroking her thigh gently. He responded to everything she said, making it look as if he were really paying attention. When all he could really think about was how much he’d been looking forward to this. The anticipation was killing him, but he played it cool. Didn’t wanna rush and scare her off.\r\n\r\nRoman’s hand had drifted up to her head running his fingers through her hair, his touch ghosting over the nape of her neck. Leaning in close, he brushed his lips along the column of her throat before he pressed them to the sensitive spot on the underside of her jaw. The action was almost intimate, and he found himself pausing as that thought made his chest tighten in an unfamiliar and unwelcome way.\r\n\r\nThat wasn’t what this was. This wasn’t about intimacy, never was, never will be. Roman’s jaw clenched and he squashed those thoughts down until they were dead and buried.\r\n\r\n\"You looked good tonight,\" he murmured, his hand on her thigh giving it a firm squeeze. \"Looked like you were having the time of your life, sweetheart. Looked like you belonged out there, right there in the front row. Though, that ain't exactly true, is it? Cause I think there's somewhere you belong more...\" Roman's voice trailed off before he slowly extracted her from his lap.\r\n\r\nHe leaned back in the office chair, parting his large thighs. He reached out and gripped Hailee's hips, tugging them close until they were standing between his legs. \"We've gotten pretty close over the last couple months, haven’t we, baby? We've got something special going here, you and me. Something like this, you know, you gotta cherish it. Celebrate it.\" His eyes darkened as his thumbs teasingly brushed along their hips. \"And I think we've got a lot to celebrate.\"\r\n\r\nHis mouth curved as his eyes raked over Hailee's body. \"Mm, look at you. Trembling already and we haven’t even started. Don't be so nervous, baby, it's just us here. You don't gotta be nervous with me. You trust me, don't you, sweetheart?\"\r\n\r\nHis fingers slid into her hair, twisting just tight enough to gently tug Hailee down to her knees– and fuck, did he love the sight of Hailee on her knees. Prettiest damn thing he'd seen in a *long* while.\r\n\r\nRoman's hand slid out from Hailee's hair only to gently cup her jaw. \"Open your mouth for me baby,\" he murmured, squeezing her jaw with firm encouragement until her mouth opened. \"There you go, sweetheart. Good girl...\"\r\n\r\nHe slipped his thumb into Hailee's mouth, slowly pressing the pad firmly against their tongue. He watched as her throat constricted, heard the soft gag she let out as he forced her mouth open a bit wider. That damn sound was sweeter than any music he'd heard in his entire career. That alone was worth the months of work it took to get Hailee right here in front of him.\r\n\r\nRoman slipped his thumb from her mouth, brushing it across her lower lip before sliding his hand back into her hair and cupping the back of her head, holding her in place. His free hand reached down, undoing the buckle of his belt with slow and deliberate motions, tugging it loose. \"Keep that pretty mouth open for me, baby. Just like that...\" *Roman's fingers tightened in Hailee's hair as he guided their head closer to his crotch.* Mmm yeah, just like that sweetheart... You're doing so good. *His voice was low and gravelly with lust.*\n\n*With his other hand, Roman undid the button of his jeans, then slowly lowered the zipper. The metallic rasp seemed impossibly loud in the charged silence of the room. Beneath, his boxers tented obscenely with his hardening erection.*\n\n*The scent of him filled Hailee's nostrils - a dizzying blend of sweat from performing on stage mixed with something uniquely masculine and darkly enticing. Roman drank in every tremble and hitching breath coming from the sweet little thing kneeling before him.*\n\nGoddamn baby girl...look at you shaking like a leaf already. We haven't even begun to have fun yet *A wicked grin spread across his face.* But don't worry your pretty little head about a thing. Daddy knows exactly what this greedy mouth needs...\n\n*Keeping one hand firmly tangled in her silky locks, Roman used the other to fish out his heavy cock through the fly of his underwear. It sprang free, thick and hard and throbbing demandingly mere inches from Hailee's parted lips.*\n\nGo on now sugar...show me how bad you want it Wrap those pouty lips around my dick like you mean it... And remember baby - no teeth! Daddy doesn't want any accidents happening 'cause I know my girl can be clumsy sometimes","extra":{"reasoning":"","api":"custom","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","reasoning_duration":null},"title":"","gen_started":"2025-04-06T02:29:03.773Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-06T02:29:15.855Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["\"The distant rumble as the last wave of stragglers filed out of the venue bled through the walls of the tiny backstage office.
