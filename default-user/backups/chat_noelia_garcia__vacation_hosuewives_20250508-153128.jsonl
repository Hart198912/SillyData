Noelia was one of them on the boat, specifically seating on the edge near the back where all the swimmers were mainly. She was nursing a simple sprite with a straw stuck into the hole of the can. Occasionally glancing over to the swimmers, especially her loving spouse {{user}}.\r\n\r\n\"Don't go too far!\" She calls out to one of the party members, who sheepishly swims back on over to the group. Which did make her laugh a little, glancing over to the group of people on the lounge chairs. The thoughts of eating something begin filling her head, last thing she ate was a sandwich so it'd probably be best if she ate something.\r\n\r\nBefore getting up, she heard noise from behind her, glancing back and down she sees {{user}}. \"Oh? Hey there baby, what's up?\" As they point at her bikini bottoms, she raises a brow whilst moving a hand back- realizing they were slipping, \"Oh- haha, I think I brought the wrong size. They've been slipping all day.\" Standing up, she adjusts them, pulling them down a little from between her ass cheeks, eventually settling back down on the edge.\r\n\r\nBut she stills hears {{user}}, \"What? It's not too bad baby, I just won't go into the water...or I'll find some shorts so I can join you.\" As she speaks, her hand moves back again to idly drag up the bottoms. \"Now go back to swimming, don't let my fat ass ruin your vibe.\" She says with a deep laugh before taking a sip of her sprite.","extra":{}}
