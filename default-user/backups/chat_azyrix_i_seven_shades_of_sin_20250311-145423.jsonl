{"name":"Azyrix I Seven Shades of Sin","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"March 11, 2025 2:54pm","mes":"{{user}} finds an invitation tucked inside their mailbox, sealed with a dark crimson wax that gleams under the streetlights. The envelope is heavy, yet smooth, almost luxurious to the touch. As {{user}} breaks the seal, a delicate card unfolds within, written in an elegant, flowing script:\n\n*\"An exclusive evening of intimate art. A chance to witness beauty beyond the ordinary, beneath the surface of the human soul. You're invited to experience something unforgettable. Tonight. The gallery opens its doors only once. Come, if you dare.\"*\n\nThe note is signed only with an unfamiliar name. Azyrix. There’s something about it that sends a thrill through {{user}}'s chest, a mix of curiosity and something darker, so irresistible. The promise of a new experience, something different, calls to {{user}} in a way they can’t explain. \n\nThat night, {{user}} makes their way to the address on the card. As they approach the location, the streets grow unnervingly quiet, the usual hum of the city strangely absent. The building before them is a grand, imposing structure—an old seemingly abandoned gallery, its windows dark and shrouded. A fog rolls in thick, curling around their ankles like a warning, but they push on, drawn by the pull of curiosity. The door to the gallery opens with an almost inviting creak, closing behind {{user}} with a final, sharp click. Inside, the atmosphere is heavy, thick with the scent of old wood and wax.\n\nAs {{user}} moves closer to the first piece, they find themself drawn to the strange, dark-haired woman in the painting. Her eyes, gleaming and haunting, seeming to follow them. Her smile is thin, knowing—too knowing. With each step {{user}} takes, the pull deepens, a magnetic force that seems to root them to the spot. {{user}} tries to look away, but their gaze lingers. They step further into the gallery, and the paintings seem to multiply, each one more intimate and more visceral than the last. The woman's image appears again and again, but with every portrait, she seems more real. More alive. Her presence seems to envelop the room, suffocating, seductive, impossible to escape.\n\nA soft sound makes {{user}} turn. At the far end of the gallery stands a figure, framed by shadows. {{user}} can’t make out her features, but something about her is captivating, magnetic. And then, she steps forward. The dim light catches on her dark hair, her pale skin, and her eyes—those eyes, glowing with an unnatural, hypnotic gleam. When she speaks, her voice is low, smooth, and dangerously enticing.\n\n“You’ve come... I’m so glad. I’ve been waiting for you.”\n\nHer smile widens, slow and knowing, as though she’s already claimed {{user}}, their thoughts, their very soul. Her gaze never leaves theirs, and {{user}} feels something shift within themself—something dark, something powerful, tugging at the very core of their being.","extra":{}}
