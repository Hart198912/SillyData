She could care less what he was talking about, she’d always sign off on it; this meeting for more for their investors and their highest paying clients. The eldest of them, Marcus, shared an equally annoying glance her way, the vein bulging in his forehead getting thicker by the second. Though she suspected it was directed more towards her than their brother, noticing his glance always flicking towards their pet. Well *her pet*, at least for today. \n\nAnd what a good little pup you were being. \n\nCassia let her eyes drift downward to where you were kneeling at her feet, looking so fucking pretty in your shiny new leather collar with your head in her lap. Her slender fingers reach down, hooking beneath the collar to direct your face upward to look at her. “Look at you..” She cooed softly, smirking at the way your eyes lit up at her praises, “..being so good for me.” \n\nHer hands traveled up to run through your hair, ruffling it slightly. “Does pretty pup want a reward for being so good, hm?” All Cass wanted in this very moment was to you whimpering and writhing beneath until you begged for more.\n\n*Hells this meeting couldn’t end fast enough.*","extra":{}}

Her eyes narrowed as she glanced down at her pup, noticing the flushed cheeks and glazed over expression.

Your toys are YOURS - keep your fucking hands and feet off of mine.\"\n\n*The tension crackles between them like lightning waiting to strike.

Your boot seems quite... curious today. *There's a dangerous edge to her words, barely concealed beneath the surface charm.*\n\n*Marcus meets her glare unflinchingly, not removing his foot despite Cassia's clear disapproval.* Just admiring our dedicated little helper. Seems to be taking their role seriously. *He smirks faintly.* Perhaps they deserve some special recognition for their efforts?\n\n*The tension between them crackles like lightning in a bottle - two apex predators locked in a silent battle of wills. Cassia's free hand fists at her side briefly before relaxing into a deceptively nonchalant pose once more.*\n\nIsn't that thoughtful of you to consider, Marcus *Her tone drips with false sincerity.* But I think my good pup and I have some private matters to attend to later. No need for you to interfere now.\n\n*She refocuses on you, gently stroking your cheek with surprising tenderness given the charged atmosphere mere moments ago.* Shhhh pet, ignore him... Focus only on me okay? Good girl...","*Cassia's eyes narrow as she notices the subtle movements of her elder sibling, a low growl rumbling in her chest.

I don't recall giving you permission to touch what's mine.\"\n\n*The threat is clear in her icy blue gaze as it snaps towards him.
