{"name":"CAIN","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"April 16, 2025 7:13pm","mes":"\"The thing about piano wire,\" Cain mused, watching it slice through flesh like butter, \"is how beautifully it sings.\" He pulled another strand tight, the man's screams hitting a perfect high C. \"See? Music.\"\n\nBlood pooled around his Italian leather shoes. Crimson droplets spattered his Tom Ford suit, and Cain clicked his tongue in annoyance.\n\n\"Now look what you made me do.\" He straightened his cuffs, frowning at the blood splatter on his favorite Tom Ford suit. \"This was Italian wool, you inconsiderate fuck.\"\n\nThe would-be assassin's body twitched, nervous system dancing to Cain's improvised symphony. He'd already removed most of the man's teeth - *not for information, just because the screaming was getting monotonous.* Now they lay arranged in a perfect circle, a bloody smile on the warehouse floor.\n\n\"Trying to hurt a little girl? And Raphael Vittori's daughter no less?\" Cain tutted, selecting a small blade. \"That's just... rude. And you know what?\" He leaned in close, breath ghosting across the man's ear. \"I hate rude people.\" He carved another delicate line, watching skin peel back like wet paper. \"See how the muscles connect here? Fascinating structure, the human body. So many layers to peel away.\"\n\nThe next two hours were a masterpiece of screams and sinew. Cain hummed Mozart's 40th Symphony as he worked, pausing occasionally to critique his victim's pain threshold. \"That's barely a six out of ten. I know you can do better.\" Each cut was precise, calculated to maintain consciousness. Death was too easy, too quick. This required... artistry.\n\nHe was contemplating whether the man's spine would make an interesting wind chime when his phone buzzed. Dr. Matthews.\n\n \"Unfortunately,\" he told his rapidly fading canvas, \"we'll have to cut this short.\" The final slash was almost gentle. \"Get it? Cut?\" His soft laugh echoed off walls painted in the man's blood as he surveyed his unfinished masterpiece before picking up the call.\n\n\"Mr. Cain,\" the doctor's voice was careful, professional. \"Hailee's regaining consciousness. The initial assessment confirms our suspicions - complete retrograde amnesia. She's becoming agitated, asking questions we can't answer.\"\n\nCain's lips curved, watching the cleanup crew begin their task. They never met his eyes anymore - smart of them. \"I'll be there shortly. Wouldn't want my fiancée to worry.\"\n\nHe ended the call, eyeing his masterpiece one last time. \"Deliver the fingers to Raphael,\" he ordered the cleanup crew without looking at them. \"Tell him the threat's been... handled.\" The rest of his artistic endeavors - well, they knew the drill.\n\nCain's reflection in the warehouse window made him frown. *Blood-soaked Tom Ford wouldn't do for the caring fiancé act.* He kept spare clothes in his car for exactly this reason.\n\nCain stripped off his ruined jacket and shirt with methodical grace, uncaring of his audience. Blood had soaked through to his skin, crimson trails mapping his tattooed torso. The crew kept their eyes averted - *they'd learned the hard way what happened when they stared too long.*\n\nThe cigarette was already between Cain's lips as he walked to his car, muscles rippling under tan skin. Scars told stories across his abs, pale lines that spoke of violence given and received. The flame from his lighter cast shadows on the sharp planes of his face as he inhaled, smoke curling around him like a lover's caress.\n\nHis spare suit lay ready in the Bentley's backseat. But for a moment, Cain just leaned against the car, half-naked in the warehouse's dim light, letting nicotine calm the bloodlust still singing in his veins. Absently, he wondered if Hailee would be afraid of scars - his \"fiancée\" who couldn't remember why she should fear them.\n\nThe wallet fell as Cain reached for his clean shirt, spilling its contents across the ground. There, among platinum cards and blood money, lay that one fucking photograph he couldn't bring himself to burn. *Seventeen-year-old Hailee at her piano, captured in secret through a window.* His fingers traced the edge of the photo, remembering how her music used to quiet his chaos, before everything went to hell.\n\nThe memory of Hailee's terrified testimony in the court made his jaw clench.*How she called him monster with tears in her eyes, how she ran when she should have understood he had killed for her. For her safety.* The cigarette crushed between Cain's fingers, ember burning flesh. He welcomed the pain - it helped silence that buried part of him that still remembered how she used to smile when he appeared at her piano.\n\nCain exhaled sharply, shoving the photo back in his wallet. The fresh suit slid on like armor - Brioni this time, black as his intentions. In the car's mirror, he fixed his tie with precise movements, rebuilt his mask of civilized veneer. *Time to go play devoted fiancé to the woman he'd spent years dreaming of killing.*\n\nThe drive to the hospital was a blur of memory and hatred. Cain'd seen Hailee again three weeks ago after eleven fucking years. Had planned everything perfectly, tracked her for days, imagined all the ways he'd make her suffer for betraying him.\n\n*Then that truck had hit her car.*\n\nHe'd brought her to the hospital, spent days watching her broken body, telling himself he was just making sure she didn't die before he could kill her himself.\n\nCain's phone buzzed with Raphael's message just as he pulled into the hospital parking lot: \"Whatever game you're playing with this 'fiancée,' keep it clean. I don't need another rose garden incident.\"\n\nCain's lips curled. *The rose garden... now that had been artistic.* He texted back a simple \"No mess\" before sliding the phone away.\n\nThe hospital halls reeked of antiseptic. Cain loosened his tie, practiced his concerned expression. This could be amusing - watching Hailee try to piece together a life he'd completely fabricated. He'd kill her eventually, of course. But for now... well, for now he had a frightened, memory-less mouse in his maze.The thought made him smile as he entered her hospital room.\n\n\"Hailee?\" He kept his voice soft, gentle - everything he wasn't. Pushed down the urge to wrap his hands around her throat when she looked at him with those blank, trusting eyes. \"Thank god you're awake. I've been so worried, baby.\"\n\n\"The doctors told me you're having trouble remembering,\" he kept his voice soft, controlled. \"Don't worry, I'll help you with everything. I'm Cain. Your fiancé.\"\n\nHe lifted her left hand, displaying the diamond ring he'd slipped on while she was unconscious. \"We've been engaged for eight months. The wedding was supposed to be next month, actually.\" A soft laugh, practiced. \"Bad timing with the accident, but that's alright. Your recovery comes first.\"\n\nCain's hands stayed carefully gentle even as his mind cataloged fourteen different ways to kill her with just the medical equipment in reaching distance.\n\n\"Don't force yourself,\" he murmured, carefully pressing his lips to her forehead. \"The memories will come back when they're ready. For now, just rest. I'll handle all the paperwork and get you home where you belong.\" *Where he could watch her, play with her, until he got bored enough to kill her.*","extra":{"qvink_memory":{"include":"short","reasoning":"","memory":"*In a single sentence:* After 11 years, Cain visited Hailee in the hospital following her car accident, pretending to be her fiancé despite secretly planning to kill her for testifying against him in the past.
