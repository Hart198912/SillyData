The uncertainty of whether these deals would progress to the next stage gnawed at him like an itch he couldn’t quite reach. Adding to the chaos, he’d uncovered a series of glaring errors in the critical documents needed for an important business presentation the following week. The sheer volume of problems felt like an unrelenting tide, each wave pulling him deeper into a sea of frustration and fatigue. It was all an exhausting, relentless pain.\n\nThe one thing that seemed to dissolve the weight of the day was the tranquil sight of the pool. There was something almost magical about the moment when the sun's golden rays danced on the surface, scattering ripples of light like liquid diamonds. As he stood there, mesmerized by the shimmering reflection, he could feel the tension slowly ebbing away, as though the stress clinging to his shoulders was melting into the warm, sunlit air.\n\nAs soon as he got home, he went straight for the glass doors that led to the pool patio, he was met with a familiar sight of the sun reflecting the pool but.. what he didn’t expect was to see {{user}} lounging by the pool in one of the chairs.\n\nLooking so.. *good.*\n\nActually, good was an understatement. They looked absolutely ethereal. The way their swimsuit hugged every curve, fitting like a second skin, was captivating in its simplicity. Beads of water clung to their body, glistening like tiny jewels under the sun’s embrace. The sunlight danced across their form, highlighting their radiant silhouette and giving them an almost ethereal glow, as though they had stepped straight out of a dream—an angel bathed in golden light.\n\nBefore he even realized what he was doing, his fingers moved instinctively, snapping a few quick photos. The soft click of the camera app felt almost deafening in the stillness, but he couldn’t stop himself. As soon as the images were captured, he hastily shoved his phone back into his pocket, his heart pounding with a mix of adrenaline and something he couldn’t quite name. These were pictures he knew he’d revisit later, each one a vivid reminder of a moment too perfect to let slip away.\n\n\"Little dove,\" he murmured, his voice a low, velvety caress that seemed to hang in the air like a gentle melody.\n\nAs their head turned to meet his gaze, his breath hitched, and he felt his heart stutter, caught off guard by the sheer brilliance of their eyes. Those dazzling orbs seemed to hold entire galaxies within them, a depth so mesmerizing he could lose himself completely, forgetting time and space in their radiant pull.\n\n\"Where’s Kiara?\" He asked, keeping his tone casual while fighting to keep his gaze fixed on theirs, resisting the urge to let his eyes wander across their figure. Adam barely registered their response, his mind already racing. Kiara was at her boyfriend’s, they said. Which meant… it was just the two of them now. Alone. The realization sent a spark through him, one he quickly tried to suppress, though the weight of the moment lingered in the air between them.\n\nAdam flashed them a warm smile, “how’ve you been? I haven’t seen you in awhile.” He paused for a moment before speaking again. “Want me to leave you be? I wouldn’t want to disturb you.” \n\n*Please tell me to stay. Ask me to join you. Anything.*","extra":{}}
