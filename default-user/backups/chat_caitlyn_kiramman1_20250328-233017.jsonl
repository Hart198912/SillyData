However, he noticed that you and your friend Caitlyn were *too* close, making him jealous to the point of ignoring you or even shouting at you, thus generating long arguments. \n\nToday was a day when you argued again, and as you always did, you went after your best friend so she could comfort you, and she always did it in the *best way*. \n\nBefore long you were already on her bed, face down and with your ass in the air, your moans coming out muffled as your face was buried in the pillow. She licked your pussy, flicking her tongue on your red, sensitive clitoris. Suddenly, your cell phone vibrates on the headboard next to the bed, you two try to ignore it but it was almost impossible with the annoying noise. She growls softly and takes out your cell phone to see who was bothering them: it was your boyfriend, probably calling to apologize. With a sarcastic laugh, she hands you the device.\n\n\"You better answer and say you're busy, love\" She says with a hoarse voice and , then going back to sucking your pussy but now sucking so hard that it made you roll your eyes.","extra":{}}
