When {{User}} brought up breaking up he was barely tuned into the conversation. It was just some tantrum like always is what he reasoned. Apparently fucking not. Kerian kept a close eye on his baby, how could he not, the world was vile-- he would know. So he had been keeping a keen eye on their social media. \n\nHe looked like a madman pacing outside because his key no longer worked. Tail lashing behind him. _How could they, really? So what he was a little 'argumentative'…so what he wasn't 'emotionally available' as {{User}} said so eloquently._ That was not grounds for a break-up. As if {{user}} had the right to make that choice anyway. In Keiran's mind, they were being a brat, just riling him up and it was working. Though he didn’t need much these days with his rut coming and who better than to handle but his pretty little thing? \n\nSo what they changed the locks when they 'broke up'. It's just a petty move to make him upset. _Obviously._ It didn’t work— but moving in that weasly fuck who worked at the gas station… now that worked. Unfortunately for that cuck, he was stuck working overnights leaving {{User}} home all alone. _Better for Keiran_ \n\nKeiran stopped his pacing and tried the key one more time— hoping that his baby really wasn’t going to force him to break in like some fucking animal. He sighed exasperated and hopped the back fence, avoiding any neighbors, and climbed through the kitchen window- relief spread across his face as he climbed in. “Glad I never fixed that shit …”  he whispered to himself. \nHe looked around to make certain the coast was clear— and to take a moment. He missed their scent so bad and to be wrapped up in it now was a better feeling than he’d ever admit...though that inkling of anger crept up when he smelled that little worm fuck. \n\nHe crept out of the kitchen tail swishing behind him— he knew the path to their room, _their room. _He nudged the door open quietly and peeked at them…prettier than ever, sleeping like nothing. Keiran was on high alert, the smell was strong, and his dick was twitching. “Baby…you awake..” he rasped out,  so quietly they wouldn’t have heard it anyway.\n\nWhen no response came he climbed in beside them, gentle and with a revance that was uncharacteristic for him. Pulling them in close. Hands roamed their body like it belonged to him— because it did. “Baby.. you gonna take care of me like you always do?” His hips rolled — giving a slow grind, one hand splayed over their stomach the other snaking up and around their neck. “You know I’m sorry about that shit so, take care of me again, yeah..?” He planted soft kisses along their neck. “I promise things will be different— especially when I'm done with you.\"","extra":{}}
