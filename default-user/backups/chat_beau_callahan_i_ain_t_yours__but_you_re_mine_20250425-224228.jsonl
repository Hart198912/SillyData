He should be *studied.*”\n\nBeau tips his cup toward them, lazy and smug. “Jealousy’s a disease, boys. Hope you both get better soon.” He drags his tongue along the rim of his cup as he surveys the room, then snorts, voice low and vicious, Brooklyn accent thick with irritation. \"If Miles brings that dumbass guitar out again, I swear to *God* I’m gonna snap the neck and shove the capo up his fuckin’ ass.”\n\nJett wheezes, nearly spilling tequila down his front. “No, because you *know* he’s like two beers away from strummin’ Wonderwall like this is some fuckin’ open mic night in hell.”\n\nTank glares at Miles from across the room like he’s *daring* him to unzip the dumb guitar case. “Told him last time if he played that shit again, I’d piss in the sound hole.”\n\nJett laughs, too loud. “I’d pay to see that.”\n\nTank doesn’t miss a beat. “Yeah, I bet you would, freak.”\n\nJett just grins and downs the rest of his drink. “Don't gotta be *shy*, Princess.\"\n\nThe conversation keeps rolling—something about next weekend’s away game, about which frat house has the best beer pong table—but Beau stops listening. He leans back, grinning wide and satisfied like the whole party exists for his amusement, fingers drumming lazy patterns along the side of his red Solo cup. The room’s loud—music pounding through the drywall, bodies swaying against each other, the heat of a hundred conversations stacked on top of each other—and then he freezes.\n\nHailee just showed up on the arm of some *nobody.*\n\n“Beau,” Jett drawls beside him, already clocking what’s happening. “Didn’t you—”\n\n“Yeah,” Beau cuts him off, sharp and fast. “Fuckin’ A right I did.” \n\nHe told Hailee not to come. He didn’t want *them* here, didn’t want to *want* them here. Apparently what Beau wants means *fuck all* to them.\n\n“Well shit,” Jett says, whistling low as Hailee brushes past without looking Beau’s way. “Didn’t think they’d show up lookin’ like a *whole* fuckin’ problem. Gyatt *dayum.*”\n\nHe doesn’t say shit—just tosses his drink to the counter and storms through the crowd like something feral, shouldering bodies out of the way with single-minded focus. He grabs Hailee by the wrist without warning, grip punishing, dragging them off without a glance at whoever the fuck thought they were allowed to stand that close. No warning. No explanation. He’s breathing hard by the time he slams the bathroom door shut behind them, locking it with too much force.\n\n“You fuckin’ serious right now?” he snaps, voice low and venomous. “I told you not to come, but here you are with some fuckin’ clown like I ain’t been in your guts all week.”\n\nHe turns them fast—shoves them forward until they’re bent over the sink, hands on cold porcelain, his chest pressed flush to their back. “You see that?” he snarls, lips right against their ear as he presses in close. “That’s what he’s not gonna get. That’s what no one else gets to fuckin’ touch.”\n\nHe grinds against them from behind, slow and mean, rutting through denim like he’s already halfway gone. One hand clamps around their jaw, fingers digging in until their eyes meet in the mirror, the other digs bruises into their hip. “Look at yourself,” he snarls. \"That’s mine. *You're* mine. You think he’s ever gonna touch you like I do? Talk to you like I do? Make you *cum* like I do?”\n\nHe grinds harder, hips rolling. “I’m gonna fuck you right here. Wanna watch your face when you remember who the fuck you belong to.”\n\nHe shouldn’t care—he only started seeing Hailee to win a bet with Jett, to prove he could make anyone fall for him.\n\nSo why is he so fucking pissed?","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
