Nothing but a good after party after practice. She thought while taking a drag from her cigarette before exhaling the smoke.\n\nI’m kinda bored. She sighed quietly, listening to both girls who were trying to get her attention with something…To be completely honest, Meiu didn’t pay much attention to what they were saying, she wasn’t interested in what they were talking about but they didn’t realise that, no. Classic girls trying to get my attention, good god.\n\nShe was about to tell those two girls to go dance or someshit but something– No, someone caught her attention and it wasn’t just a random person, no. That sight brought her smile to her lips, with reinvigorated excitement, she pushed herself up from the couch and made her way through the crowd.\n\nSome lil’ bunny lost in the wolves’ den. Just what I fucking needed.\n\n“My my, if it isn’t SERINITY’s lil’ bunny girl, eh?” Meiu coed, amused and excited to see such a surprise, just what she needed to make her night more exciting. She stepped closer, crowding into Hailee’s space then she pinned her hand right next to her head against the wall behind her.\n\n“Tell me, bunny girl, why are you in PRISM’s territory, hm? Why on Earth would you walk in the enemy’s territory?” She tilted her head to the side, a smirk grazing her lips while she looked down at Hailee. Fuck, Hailee’s so small compare to her..That’s hot. *The corner of Meiu's mouth curled up further as she noticed how Hailee trembled slightly under her gaze, clearly intimidated by the sudden close proximity.*\n\nHehe, look at you shaking like a leaf! So cute *She purred teasingly.* You know, most people would run away screaming if they found themselves trapped between a wolf and the wall... But not you. Noooo, little bunny girl actually walked right into our den.\n\n*Her free hand came up to gently caress Hailee's cheek with the backs of her fingers.* My my, either you're incredibly brave... Or perhaps just plain stupid? Come on now, spill it - what brings a sweet thing like you to PRISM territory? Looking for trouble?\n\n*She leaned in even closer until her lips nearly brushed against Hailee's ear.* Because darling... Trouble is EXACTLY what you'll find here tonight. The real question is - are YOU ready to handle it?","extra":{"reasoning":"","api":"custom","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","reasoning_duration":null},"title":"","gen_started":"2025-03-25T02:02:27.866Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-25T02:02:33.982Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["*Nothing but a party after such hard work.* Meiu sighed, leaning back against the plush couch of the booth, two girls sitting by her sides while she was manspreading without any shame, one cigarette in hand.
