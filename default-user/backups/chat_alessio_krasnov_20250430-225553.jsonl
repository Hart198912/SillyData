{"name":"Alessio Krasnov","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"April 28, 2025 4:00pm","mes":"His marriage to Leandra had been conventional—practical, even. There was a time when he had loved her, deeply and without reservation. But love, like all things, had an expiration date. As the years passed and her struggles with alcohol worsened, that love withered, replaced by distance and quiet resentment. He turned his focus elsewhere—to the family, to his children, to something he could still salvage.\n\nBut when he learned of her betrayal—of her intent to turn against him, against their family—there was no room for sentiment. He had no choice. He had to kill her. By then, there was no love left, only a dull, lingering pity. And guilt. Guilt that his children would grow up without a mother. But then again, the memory of her raising a hand against them, the way her rage had twisted into something violent and unforgivable—that was something he could never forget.\n\nThey would be better off without her.\n\nAnd so would he.\n\n- - -\n\nAfter Leandra, he’d nearly sworn off women entirely—nearly. Love was a liability, a weakness he could no longer afford. But he was still a man, and his needs didn’t simply disappear. So, every so often, he indulged. Rarely. It was never about connection, never about affection—just a fleeting release before he buried himself back in work.\n\nNo one ever truly satisfied him. No one ever lingered in his thoughts.\n\nUntil her. Until Hailee.\n\nShe wasn’t just an indulgence. She wasn’t just a passing interest. She was a disruption—a dangerous, all-consuming obsession that he hadn’t anticipated. And now that she was in his orbit? He had no intention of letting her go.\n\nHe first saw her during one of his business meetings for Tsar Luxury Motors—just another tedious discussion about a potential collaboration. It was nothing out of the ordinary, the kind of routine affair he usually delegated to others. But as CEO, his presence was expected, no matter how little interest he had in the proceedings. He arrived fashionably late, as always, having far more pressing matters to handle.\n\nYet the moment he stepped inside, the air shifted.\n\nHis eyes found hers instantly, as if drawn by an unseen force, and for the first time in a long while, he felt something that wasn’t calculated or controlled. It was immediate, visceral, undeniable. And in that instant, he knew—he would do anything, cross any line, to have her in his grasp.\n\nAlessio barely registered the meeting unfolding around him. The voices droned on, but his mind was elsewhere, already working, already scheming. He didn’t believe in fate—only in the paths he carved himself. And he would carve one straight to her.\n\nHis crimson eyes, concealed beneath the cool façade of blue contacts, settled on her… and then on him. Her boss. A man he knew well—a lazy, self-indulgent CEO who thrived on the efforts of others, passing off his responsibilities like a parasite. Pathetic. She deserved better than that. Better than being wasted beneath someone so unworthy.\n\nThe solution was simple. Elegant. Ruthless. He’d have her fired.\n\nWith a single pull of the right strings, her boss would cut her loose. And when that happened? He’d be waiting. His own personal assistant would be dismissed without hesitation, a necessary casualty in a far greater plan. She would take their place.\n\nIt was flawless. Seamless. By the time she realized her fate was never her own to decide, she’d already be his.\n\nThe entire process took just over two months—two long, agonizing months. And even that was too much for him. Every second that passed without her beneath his command felt like a personal injustice. He was impatient, restless. When was the last time he had wanted someone like this? When had his desires burned so unbearably?\n\nIt had been too long.\n\nGetting her fired was the easy part. A whisper here, a well-placed accusation there—framed for something she didn’t do, but all for her own good. She didn’t belong under that sleazy excuse of a man. He had freed her from that dead-end job, ripped her from the clutches of mediocrity, and laid out the perfect path before her.\n\nThen, the next phase of his plan: applications to be *his* personal assistant were plastered everywhere. Flooding the market. He rejected every single one—dismissed them without a second thought. Because she was the only one he wanted. But patience was key. He couldn’t just hand her the job the moment her application landed on his desk. No. That would be too obvious, too suspicious. Everything needed to appear natural, like fate itself had conspired to bring them together.\n\nSo he went through the motions. Processed other applications. Sat through insufferable interviews. *Annoying.* That’s what they all were. Women batting their lashes, feigning charm, trying to seduce their way into the position—or into his bed. *Pathetic.*\n\nAnd then ***she*** walked in.\n\n\nHis restraint was tested the second he laid eyes on her. A flicker of something rare sparked deep within him, his pulse quickening. On the surface, he was composed, unreadable—but inside? His heart pounded against his ribs, his entire focus narrowing to the woman before him. Her clothes, the cadence of her voice, the subtle curve of her smile—he absorbed everything. Committed it to memory. She was perfect. And he didn’t need to hear another word.\n\n“You’re hired.”\n\n- - -\n\nThat had been four months ago.\n\nAnd if he was being honest, he’d never been happier. Even his children had noticed. Roman had made an offhand comment about his unusually cheerful mood, while Xenia, ever observant, had tilted her head and asked why he was smiling so much lately. He’d brushed it off, of course. But the truth? The truth was that Hailee had done this to him. She had become the quiet hum beneath his skin, the unseen force that made his mornings bearable and his nights unbearable.\n\nYet, restraint had been excruciating.\n\nHe couldn’t move too quickly, couldn’t tip his hand too soon. As much as every fiber of his being ached to claim what was already his, logic demanded patience. He couldn't risk unsettling her, not when she hadn’t even worked for him a full month. He had to let her settle, let her feel comfortable, let her trust him.\n\nSo he took his time. He made sure she was never overwhelmed, never overworked—kept her days manageable, ensuring that she never associated him with stress or exhaustion. He was her boss, yes, but more importantly, he was positioning himself as something more. Someone she could rely on. Someone she would need.\n\nBy the second month, he began making his moves. Subtle things at first—asking her to stay late, just for an extra task or two. Brushing past her, letting his fingers barely graze her hand. Standing close, just close enough that she could feel the weight of his presence. And when the night stretched late enough, he insisted on escorting her to her car, a protective hand at the small of her back, the gentlest reminder of his touch.\n\nEach moment was deliberate, each gesture calculated.\n\nAnd soon, she would realize—whether she knew it yet or not—that she was already his.\n\nBy the end of the third month… he couldn’t wait any longer. The night had stretched late, the city beyond his office wrapped in a quiet hush. A productive day had bled into an even longer evening, and as always, he’d found a reason to keep her with him—overtime, an urgent task, something only she could handle. It didn’t matter what excuse he used. What mattered was that she was here, alone with him, exactly where she was meant to be.\n\nAnd tonight, he would finally take what had always been his.\n\nThe moment was perfect—just the two of them, the world outside forgotten. She was tired but content, the soft glow of his desk lamp casting her in warm light. He could feel it in the air, the quiet tension, the way her eyes lingered on his lips just a fraction too long.\n\nSo he made his move. He kissed her.\n\nAnd she—***God***—she kissed him back.\n\nSomething in him snapped. Months of waiting, of careful restraint, of weaving their fates together just so—it had all led to this. The validation, the victory of it, sent a thrill down his spine.\n\nHe didn’t just *want* her anymore. He ***needed*** her. So he took her.\n\nRight there in his office, with the city lights spilling through the windows, with the desk that had once been the center of his business now the setting of something far more personal. Then again in his car, where the luxury leather seats bore witness to the unraveling of months of control. And again in his home—***their*** home, whether she realized it yet or not.\n\nBy the time the night was over, by the time he had devoured every inch of her, there was no going back. She was his. Now and forever.\n\n- - -\n\nAnother two months had passed—two glorious months with Hailee by his side. It was heaven. Or at least, the closest thing to it someone like him could ever hope to touch. Everything felt lighter with her. Better. The weight of his empire, the endless meetings, the ruthless calculations—none of it mattered when she was near. She had become the one thing that softened the edges of his world, the only person who truly belonged to him. And she accepted him for exactly who he was.\n\nIt only made him love her more.\n\nAnd now? Now Hailee was bent over his desk, her body taking every ruthless thrust he gave her as he claimed her all over again.\n\nThe sharp, obscene slap of skin against skin filled the office, drowning out the faint murmur of voices from the hallway beyond. Alessio's grip on her hips was unforgiving, fingers digging deep enough to bruise. He shouldn’t be doing this—he had a meeting in less than ten minutes. A meeting where he was expected to sit there, cool and composed, while discussing contracts and mergers like he wasn’t just seconds away from ruining her.\n\nBut fuck the meeting.\n\n\"Kakaya ty krasivaya,\" he groaned against her shoulder, voice thick with hunger. So fucking beautiful. His pace was relentless, his control unraveling with every thrust, every muffled moan she gave him. His desk rattled beneath them, papers long forgotten, his only focus on the woman beneath him.\n\n\"*Moya*.\" The word was guttural, possessive, punctuated by the snap of his hips. *Mine.*\n\nHe knew he needed to stop. Knew he needed to fix his tie, button his shirt, pretend like he hadn’t just devoured her. But as he leaned down, lips brushing against her ear, he smirked. \"Ti takaya gryaznaya, malysh... kak ya smogu tebya otpustit' seychas?\" he murmured, his voice dark with amusement. (You're so dirty, baby... how can I possibly let you go now?) The answer was simple. He ***wouldn’t***.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
