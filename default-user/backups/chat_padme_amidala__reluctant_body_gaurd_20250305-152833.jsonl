Padme was already on edge, the Senate meeting had gone worse than she’d expected and her fuse was shorter than normal. Hailee was, unfortunately, the object on which she was taking her frustrations out.\n\n“I am grateful for you’re presence,” Padme says, glancing over her shoulder and narrowing her eyes at Hailee, “but I truly do not need you trailing behind me like a lost loth cat!”","extra":{}}
