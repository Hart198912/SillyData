His colleagues leaned forward, charts and graphs laid out before them, their voices a monotonous drone that barely registered in his mind. He nodded occasionally, offering a brief smile or a sharp glance, but inside, his thoughts were a chaotic storm. \n\nImages of {{user}} flashed before him like a relentless slideshow: their body sprawled across his desk, flushed and eager, the soft sounds of their pleasure echoing in his ears like a haunting melody. *Dio mio,* he thought, *how I want to feel them again.*\n\nEach time they gasped or moaned, he could almost taste the sweetness of their skin, a lingering sensation of warmth and desire. The memory of how they trembled beneath him sent a thrill coursing through his veins, igniting a hunger that was nearly impossible to ignore. He shifted in his seat, adjusting the fit of his tailored suit as he tried to focus on the presentation. But it was futile; every word spoken only fueled his fantasies. The dull ache of longing settled deep in his core, and he felt as if he were a tight coil ready to snap.\n\n“Stefano, what do you think?” One of the executives interrupted his reverie, their gaze expectant. He forced a smile, masking the frustration that simmered beneath the surface. “Un momento,” he replied in a low voice, “this is not the time.” He waved a dismissive hand, his attention drifting back to the tantalizing vision of {{user}}. The meeting felt increasingly irrelevant, their chatter merely background noise to the symphony of desire playing in his mind.\n\nAs the meeting dragged on, he envisioned the moment he could escape, dragging {{user}} into his office where the outside world faded away. His pulse quickened at the thought of locking the door behind them, sealing away any interruptions. *In questa stanza, sarà solo noi due (In this room, it will just be the two of us)*, he mused, picturing how he would claim them entirely. The anticipation was intoxicating, a heady rush that made it hard to concentrate. Each tick of the clock echoed in his ears like a countdown to ecstasy.\n\nFinally, the last report was presented, and he could contain himself no longer. He stood abruptly, silencing the room with a commanding gaze. “That will be all,” he announced, his voice low and firm. There were murmurs of confusion, but he didn’t care; he had more pressing matters to attend to. With swift strides, he made his way to the door, his heart racing with urgency.\n\nAs soon as he stepped into his office, he turned to face {{user}}, his breath hitching at the sight of them. The intensity of his desire washed over him, and without hesitation, he reached for them. “Spogliati. Strip,” he demanded, his voice a dark growl that left no room for disobedience. The word hung heavy in the air, an electric promise of what was to come.\n\nEach moment felt like an eternity as he absorbed the sight of {{user}}, their body a perfect canvas that he longed to explore. The memory of their sounds played in his mind, mingling with the taste of their skin and the sensation of their tremors beneath him. *Questo è quello che desidero,* he thought, stepping closer, hunger flaring in his eyes. “Now.”","extra":{}}
