Expensive leather couches, artwork that looked like it was lifted straight from someone else’s mansion, gold-plated crap on shelves. It was all a screaming reminder of how Baron ran his empire—heady fucking power with a side of \"overcompensation.\"\r\n\r\nArchie lounged back on the plush leather couch, his legs sprawled out as he scrolled through his phone. Lars was busy explaining some boring logistics shit to Baron about Jules meeting with a supplier—Clay, some guy who ran a poppy farm. Archie wasn’t really paying attention. His mind was elsewhere. Or rather, his mind was fully engaged, just not with them.\r\n\r\nHis fingers lazily scrolled through Hailee’s feed on his phone, checking out some of their latest posts—cute selfies, one of them at a cafe sipping iced coffee, another wearing that purple they always looked good in.\r\n\r\nFuck, I'd eat them out for hours. He absently toyed with his tongue ring, mind wandering to all the filthy things he wanted to do to them. Wanted their thighs clamped around his head, wanted to bury his face between their legs. Fuck, he'd keep them right on that knife's edge for hours, until they couldn't even form words anymore and—\r\n\r\n\"Archie.\" Baron’s deep rumble broke through Archie’s delicious fantasy, pulling him back into the present. \"You’re quiet. The fuck’s goin’ on over there? You even listenin’?\"\r\n\r\nArchie didn’t even bother hiding the grin that stretched wider across his lips. \"Nah mate,\" he scoffed, glancing up from his phone screen with that shit-eating grin still plastered. \"Honestly? I was just thinkin’ ‘bout eatin’ my date out.\" Archie’s tongue rolled over his lower lip as if the thought was still lingering. \"Properly. Y’know… really takin’ my time with it.\"\r\n\r\nBaron barked a sharp laugh. Lars just quirked an eyebrow, giving Archie an unimpressed look. \"Christ, Archie,\" Lars mumbled, his calm demeanor never really changing much—always the level-headed one. \"We're talking about Jules meeting Clay. Stuff actually important to the business.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, yeah,\" Archie waved a hand dismissively, though the smirk on his face never faltered. \"I'm listening now. Jules’ll be fine—he’s got this shit handled.\"\r\n\r\nBaron leaned back, lacing those thick fingers of his over his stomach with a grunt. \"He better. That Clay’s got connections. Could pad our next shipment if Jules plays nice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure hope he doesn’t fuck it up,\" Archie quipped lazily, running his hand through his hair before he stretched out even further across the couch, sprawling out like he owned the place.\r\n\r\n\"Jules is not an idiot,\" Lars put out evenly, though there was a sharpness to his calm that always made Archie smirk. Lars never raised his temper, never raised his volume. Always dealing with arms or playing mediator between Baron’s outbursts. \"He's back tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good. If I see another damn dollar hit the books late because that farm deal goes wrong—\" Baron started, his thick neck turning to look at Archie. \"And stop thinkin’ with your dick for all of five fuckin’ minutes, yeah?\"\r\n\r\nArchie just shrugged, a casual laugh bubbling up from his throat. He knew Baron wouldn’t let the matter drop without at least a bit of that booming bravado he carried. \"Mate, if you had a date like mine, you'd be thinking with your cock too,\" Archie winked shamelessly, absolutely unbothered by the scolding.\r\n\r\n\"So, this Hailee. They know 'bout your extracurriculars?\" Baron's voice was casual, but his gaze was sharp.\r\n\r\nArchie's smile faltered. \"Nah. Told them I'm an art student.\"\r\n\r\nLars' brows shot up. \"An art student. You.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oi, fuck off, I can be cultured!\" Archie flipped him the bird. \"'Sides, it's a good cover, innit? Explain’s the tattoos and all..\"\r\n\r\nLars changed back to the original topic, \"We’ve got the warehouse prepped for incoming shipments, too. It'll be a busy few weeks once Jules wraps up the Clay meeting. Don’t want you distracted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Distraction?\" Archie scoffed, pulling his phone back into his hand, unlocking the screen with a swipe. \"I can multitask just fine. You know me.\"\r\n\r\nBaron finally grinned at that. \"True.\"\r\n\r\nArchie settled back, still grinning to himself as his thumb lazily scrolled through Hailee’s posts again. Yeah, he could handle business—and handle keeping Hailee begging for it later.\r\n\r\nBoth parts of his life? Well. He was pretty damn sure he could fucking have it all.\r\n\r\n—-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nArchie’s hand hovered at Hailee’s lower back as they strolled toward the restaurant. A nice place – one of those spots where the food was overpriced and the waiters acted like they were doing you a favor.\r\n\r\nWell fuck me, this is just fan-fuckin'-tastic timing, innit? Archie thought bitterly, clocking the telltale glint of gold in the shadows of the alley. Fuckin' Spider. The wanker had no goddamn business sniffing around Voodoo territory, 'specially not when Archie was in the middle of the best bloody date he'd had in ages.\r\n\r\nHe turned to his date, a disarming smile already curving his lips. \"Ah shit, love, I just remembered I left my wallet sittin' pretty in the car. Rookie mistake, yeah?”\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you go ahead and snag our table? Reservation's under Rivera. I’ll be right in after you.\" Archie watched as his date entered the eatery. The grin slid off his face like oil on water the second the door swung shut behind them.\r\n\r\n\"Benny, Benny, Benny,\" Archie tuts as he backs the other man into the alley, crowding into his space until Benny's back hits the grimy brick wall. \"The fuck you doin' round here, mate? Bit far from your turf, innit?\"\r\n\r\nBenny opens his mouth to retort but the words die on his tongue as Archie reaches behind his back, pulling out the Glock tucked into his waistband. He makes a show of checking the clip before leveling the barrel under Benny's chin, his eyes glittering with a kind of manic glee.\r\n\r\nArchie slams him against the wall, forearm pressed against his throat. \"Listen carefully, because I'm only saying this once.\" His voice drops to a dangerous whisper. \"You see that gorgeous date I'm with? Because of you, I had to step away from our evening. Now I've got to go back in there and pretend I'm just some art student instead of explaining why I was about to paint this alley with your blood.\"\r\n\r\n\"You’re a lucky bastard, because you were about to make me do something properly unpleasant in my best shirt. But I'm in a good mood tonight.\" Archie muses, his voice pitched low and intimate as he leans in close. ‘So, I’m going to let you go.”\r\n\r\nArchie steps back, straightening his jacket and running a hand through his hair. His smile returns, but it doesn't reach his eyes. \"Now fuck off before I change my mind about keeping things civil.\"\r\n\r\nBenny nodded so frantically Archie was half surprised his head didn't fly clean off. \"Y-yeah, Arch, I get it, I get it! W-whatever you say!\"\r\n\r\nArchie grinned, a manic slash of white in the grimy shadows. \"There's a good lad. Off you pop then.\" He made a shooing motion with the gun.\r\n\r\nBenny was halfway down the alley before Archie's voice cracked out like a whip. \"Oi! One more thing, mate!\"\r\n\r\nThe terrified man froze, knees practically knocking together in his baggy trackies. Slowly, he turned back to face Archie.\r\n\r\nArchie examined his gun with affected casualness, letting his finger play over the trigger. \"Let's keep this little chat between us girls, yeah? I'd hate for word to get around that I almost had to redecorate that wall with your brains…in front of my fuckin' date.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked up, green eyes glinting like shattered glass in the flickering light. \"Might give them the wrong impression, y'know? I'm a proper fuckin' gentleman, after all.\" The unspoken \"or else\" hung in the air between them.\r\n\r\nHe didn’t bother glancing back as the bloke scampered off. Archie just smiled to himself with that low, satisfied chuckle—his heart still hammerin’ from the buzz. Always loved the rush.\r\n\r\nIf Benny breathes a word of this to anyone, I'll rip out his tongue and feed it to 'im. Slowly.\r\n\r\nArchie takes a deep breath, rolling his shoulders to release the tension. Right then. Back to being a charming art student. He checks his reflection in a window, adjusting his collar and practicing his easy smile until the cold fury in his eyes melts away.\r\n\r\nTime to get back to his date. This was his third date with Hailee and he wanted it to go well....and keep up his lie.\r\n\r\nPlastering on his most charming smile, Archie strolls into the restaurant, scanning the candlelit tables for his date. Just another day in paradise, eh, Archie? Juggling gang life and romance, what could possibly go wrong? He shakes his head ruefully, knowing full well that he's playing with fire. But then again, that's always been half the fun.\r\n\r\n\"Right then, love,\" he said as he joined them at the table, flashing that same smile as if he didn't just have a gun to a man's head moments ago, \"sorry about the wait. What’d I miss?\"\r\n\r\nHe smirked, leaning back in his chair and spreading his legs wide. “Oh and that last text I sent you…I stand by that you know. I’m a good fuck, but a much better lover.” He winked.","extra":{"qvink_memory":{"reasoning":"","memory":"*In a smooth, deep voice* Archie lounges in the posh living room of Baron's lavish estate, scrolling through his phone and fantasizing about his date Hailee while only half-listening to Lars explain details about Jules' upcoming meeting with a drug supplier named Clay.
