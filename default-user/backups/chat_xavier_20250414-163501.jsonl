No wonder they spend that much money on some pretty bottles.\n\n_Ring. Ring. Ring._\n\nThe sudden ringtone of Xavier's phone pulls him out of his thoughts, his gaze slowly sweeping across the room until it lands on the vibrating device. He just played a round of billiards with Vincent. Seems that he forgot his phone there when he sat down on that weirdly shaped couch. _I’ll never get what rich people have with weird ass furniture like this. Something artistic, they say. Art where?_\n\n“Who's calling?” Xavier calls over to his friend David. The long haired man is standing by the billiard table with Vincent, playing a round while chatting about something. Either one of them probably boasting about their most recent fucks. Vincent is throwing another party, like usual. Him and his close friends in the garage near the main house, enjoying their own private party while the masses from campus are causing chaos in the villa.\n\nDavid looks at the device, grimacing. “Your control freak of a bi- I mean, your partner.” He tells Xavier before turning the phone on quiet. Yeah, Xavier's friend group isn't so fond of Hailee. He was probably the most competitive one of the friend group, always making bets on who could land in someone's bed first. The guys had quite a lot of fun.\n\nThat is, until Hailee came around and Xavier fell head over heels for them.\n\nNow Xavier is a taken man and his friends think Hailee is turning him into a bore. “Don't talk ‘bout them like that.” Xavier responds, though his voice lacks the harshness it should probably have under given circumstances. “Just gimme my phone. I forgot to tell ‘em that I was gonna stay longer.” Xavier makes a hand movement to beckon David with the phone over. \n\nBut the fucker just turns off the phone and slips it into his jacket. “Only if you win one round against me.” David shoots back with an annoying, toothy grin. “Or are you scared you'll lose?” He makes a show of holding his chest and gasping in mock shock. “Ooooh you scared of losing?”\n\n“I'll show you, motherfucker.” Xavier huffs and shakes his head before standing up and walking towards the billiard table.\n\nHours have passed, glasses were emptied and Xavier somehow managed to get to Hailee’s place. He's drunk out of his mind, his phone turned off and back in his jacket. _Man, I wanna fuck._ Xavier thinks to himself as he knocks on Hailee’s door.\n\nNo idea how long he's been ringing and knocking but at some point Hailee opens the door, clearly ripped out of their sleep and visibly tired. Xavier stumbles towards them, his hands immediately landing on their hips. “I missed you, baby.” He whispers, the scent of alcohol in his breath.\n\nHe steps inside and pulls them with him, then closes the door shut behind with his foot. “Was thinkin’ ‘bout you all night.” Half-truths. For the most part his head was empty. Without giving Hailee a chance to respond he leans down and presses his lips on theirs, muffling any protests or curses they could be throwing at him.\n\nXavier holds his partner close and stumbles towards Hailee’s bedroom while kissing them. Once his knees hit the edge of the bed, he wraps his arms around Hailee’s waist and lets himself fall on the bed, pulling Hailee with him.\n\nXavier is laying on the red bed sheets now with Hailee straddling his lap. He shoots them a smile, his hands roaming down their sides and landing on their thighs. \"Damn, look at you.\" Xavier marvels, his eyes roaming over his partners body appreciatively.","extra":{"qvink_memory":{"include":"short","reasoning":"","memory":"*Xavier drunkenly stumbles into Hailee's apartment late at night after a party, groping and kissing them without warning. He falls onto their bed with Hailee on top of him, admiring their body as he caresses their thighs.* \"Damn, look at you,\" *he slurs appreciatively.*\n\n*Hailee is pulled from sleep by Xavier's unannounced arrival and aggressive advances. They seem irritated but don't push him away entirely.* What took you so long? I've been waiting up... *Hailee says with a sigh.*\n\n*Xavier grins lazily.* Sorry babe, lost track of time partying with the boys. You know how it gets! But hey, I'm here now *His hands continue wandering over Hailee's curves suggestively despite his inebriated state.* Mmmm come 'ere... Let me make it up to ya...\n\n*The two start making out heatedly on the rumpled red sheets as the events leading to this moment flash through Xavier's hazy memories - drinking heavily at Vincent's mansion party, trash talking friends egging him on about winning bet challenges instead of going home sooner...*","hash":6433860771519381,"error":null,"edited":false,"prefill":""}},"tracker":{}}
