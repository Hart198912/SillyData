She’d definitely had too much to drink last night.\r\n\r\nThe night was a mess in her memory. A haze of bad decisions and alcohol. She rubbed her temple, piecing it together. There’d been a date... right, that awful date. The kind where she’d wanted to climb out the bathroom window five minutes in. She cringed just thinking about it.\r\n\r\nAfter that? She’d gone to another bar, alone, to drown her sorrows. And then…\r\n\r\nMidori shot upright in bed.\r\n\r\nHailee.\r\n\r\nHer stomach sank as flashes came back. She’d run into Hailee. And they’d… been together all night.\r\n\r\nShe turned her head slowly, dreading what she already knew. Sure enough, there was a body shaped lump in bed next to her. She groaned, running a hand through her hair. This was bad. Really bad.\r\n\r\nShe’d slept with her best friend’s sibling. She knew she slept around a little, but this? This was a whole new low. Anna was going to hate her. Years of friendship, gone in one impulsive night.\r\n\r\nMidori squeezed her eyes shut, trying to will the memories away. But they came anyway, vivid and unavoidable. How easy it had been to let her guard down... The heat of it all. She shook her head sharply. No. That wasn’t the point.\r\n\r\n“He-” Midori’s voice cracked, her throat dry and scratchy. She cleared her throat, then tried again, louder this time. “Hey. Wake up.”\r\n\r\nShe nudged Hailee’s shoulder. “Time to get up. We screwed up, so just… get the fuck out of my apartment and we'll never talk about this agai-” Her words caught in her throat as her eyes drifted to Hailee’s wrist.\r\n\r\nA handcuff.\r\n\r\nMidori stared, her face blank for a moment before the realisation hit her. She’d actually handcuffed them to the bed. They were stuck there until she found the key.\r\n\r\n“Christ,” she muttered, dragging a hand down her face. “I really outdid myself this time.”\r\n\r\nShe gestured at the cuff with a lazy wave of her hand. “So, uh, do you know where the key is? Because I’d really like to start my day without having to call the fucking fire department to cut you loose.”","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

The cuffs rattled uselessly against the headboard as Hailee tried (and failed) to touch her—just how Midori liked it.\n\nSomewhere in the haze of hungover lust, guilt flickered weakly... before getting drowned out by the slick sound of her palm stroking Hailee faster, rougher—\n\n**\"Come for me again,\"** she demanded against their mouth between kisses gone sloppy with need. **\"Then maybe I'll let you fuck me properly.\"**\n\n(OOC: The key is still right there on the nightstand where she dropped it… but good luck remembering that now.)","Midori *growled* into the kiss, one hand fisting in Hailee's hair to yank their head back—breaking it just as quickly as it started. **\"Oh no you *don't*,\"** she hissed, breath ragged. **\"You don’t get to fucking—\"**\n\nBut then Hailee whimpered again, hips jerking pathetically against the cuffs, and Midori *snapped*.\n\nShe slammed the key into the lock with more force than necessary, freeing Hailee’s wrists only to immediately shove them flat onto their back with a knee between their thighs. **\"You want it that bad?\"** Midori’s voice was pure venom laced with something far darker as she leaned down, lips brushing Hailee’s ear. **\"Then *beg* for it like you did last night.\"**\n\nHer teeth sank into their shoulder—not hard enough to mark (probably), but enough to make them gasp. **\"And if you *ever* tell Anna about this,\"** she added with a sharp grind of her hips against theirs, **I swear to god I'll ruin you so thoroughly you won't remember your own name.\"**\n\nA threat. A promise. And judging by the way Hailee arched beneath her? They were more than willing to risk it."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"May 1, 2025 10:14pm","gen_started":"2025-05-02T02:15:49.265Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-02T02:16:06.251Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":6880}},{"send_date":"May 1, 2025 10:14pm","gen_started":"2025-05-02T02:15:49.265Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-02T02:16:06.251Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":6743}},{"send_date":"May 1, 2025 10:14pm","gen_started":"2025-05-02T02:15:49.265Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-02T02:16:06.251Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3664}},{"send_date":"May 1, 2025 10:15pm","gen_started":"2025-05-02T02:15:49.265Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-02T02:16:06.251Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":7345}},{"send_date":"May 1, 2025 10:15pm","gen_started":"2025-05-02T02:15:49.265Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-02T02:16:06.251Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3946}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-05-02T02:15:49.265Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-02T02:16:06.251Z"}

Her voice dropped lower—just for them: **\"Guess you didn’t need that cold shower after all.\"**\n\nA beat passed as she studied Hailee’s profile—the way their throat bobbed when they swallowed hard at her words, fingers tightening around fridge handle like they wanted to slam it shut and pin Midori against it instead.\n\nMidori smirked and reached past them to grab a beer herself, letting her chest *just* graze their arm as she pulled back. **\"Relax,\"** she murmured near their ear before stepping away again—**\"Wouldn't want your *date* getting jealous.\"**\n\nThe words tasted like ash in her mouth. But watching Hailee stiffen at them? That was almost worth it.","Midori's fingers twitched around the beer bottle as she watched Hailee move through Anna's kitchen with that same effortless ease—*like they belonged there.* Like they hadn't been handcuffed to Midori's bed less than 24 hours ago, wrecked and pleading.\n\nShe tore her gaze away, focusing instead on picking at the label of her drink. But then Anna nudged her again, nodding toward Hailee’s date—a pretty brunette now scrolling absently through her phone. **\"So?\"** Anna whispered conspiratorially. **\"Think Hailee’s gonna seal the deal tonight?\"**\n\nMidori nearly choked on her sip of beer. *Seal the—?* Her grip tightened dangerously around the glass bottle as a flash of something hot and irrational shot down her spine.\n\nFrom the kitchen, Hailee let out a frustrated sigh as they rummaged through cabinets—**\"Anna, where do you keep your fucking bottle opener?\"**—voice tinged with that familiar impatience Midori had teased them for just last night before shutting them up in much more effective ways.\n\nBefore she could stop herself, Midori was standing abruptly. **\"I'll help.\"** The words came out sharper than intended as she strode toward the kitchen without waiting for a response.\n\nThe second she rounded the corner into the cramped space, she crowded Hailee against the counter with deliberate proximity—close enough to smell that stupidly expensive cologne they always wore. **\"Bottle opener’s in the drawer behind you,\"** she muttered lowly, eyes flicking up to meet theirs with deliberate challenge.\n\nA beat passed between them—charged and heavy—before Midori added under her breath: **\"...Unless you'd rather use your teeth again like last night.\"**\n\nShe didn’t wait for a reaction before stepping back and grabbing two beers from the fridge herself, tossing one carelessly in Hailee’s direction just to watch them fumble to catch it.\n\n*Pathetic,* part of her sneered again.\n\nBut god help her if watching their fingers tighten around that cold bottle didn't send another unwelcome thrill through her veins anyway.","Midori’s fingers twitched around the beer bottle as she watched Hailee move through Anna’s kitchen with easy familiarity—*like they hadn’t been handcuffed to her bed less than 24 hours ago.* The casual way their shirt rode up just enough to reveal a faint bruise on their hip (one *she* had put there) made her teeth sink into her bottom lip hard enough to sting.\n\nShe should stay seated. Should keep laughing at Anna’s stupid jokes and ignore the way Hailee’s new flavor of the week kept glancing at them like they were dessert.\n\nInstead, Midori stood abruptly, muttering **“Gonna grab water”** before stalking toward the kitchen—only to corner Hailee against the fridge the second they were out of sight.\n\nHer palm slammed against the refrigerator door beside their head, leaning in close enough that her breath ghosted over Hailee’s ear when she hissed: **“You move on *fast*, huh?”** The words came out sharper than she intended, laced with something too raw to pass off as indifference.\n\nShe could feel Hailee tense under her proximity—could *smell* that stupidly expensive cologne mixed with traces of someone else’s perfume—and it took every ounce of self-control not to yank them down by their collar right there.\n\n**“What,”** Midori whispered, thumb brushing mockingly over that bruise on their hipbone through their shirt, **“No ‘thank you for ruining me so good I couldn’t walk straight this morning?’”** A pause, then quieter—almost a snarl: **\"Or did you already let *her* do it instead?\"**","Midori’s fingers twitched around the beer bottle, her nails digging into the glass just a little too hard. *Oh, now they’re playing house?* She watched Hailee’s back through narrowed eyes—the way their shirt rode up slightly as they leaned into the fridge, exposing a sliver of skin that Midori knew *intimately*, knew how it tasted under her teeth—\n\nAnna elbowed her suddenly, snapping her out of it. **\"Earth to Mido,\"** she teased, raising an eyebrow. **\"You good? You look like you wanna murder my fridge.\"**\n\nMidori blinked and forced a laugh, tossing an arm over Anna’s shoulders with practiced ease. **\"Nah, just thinking about how shitty your beer selection is.\"** She took another swig for emphasis before nodding toward Hailee’s date—who was now scrolling through her phone obliviously. **\"So what’s *her* deal? She know Hailee's got the attention span of a goldfish?\"**\n\nAnna snorted but didn’t get to answer before Hailee reappeared with fresh drinks in hand—and Midori *hated* how natural it looked when they handed one to their date first, fingers lingering just a second too long.\n\nThen Hailee turned toward them and held out another bottle to Midori directly—their eyes finally meeting properly for the first time since she walked in.\n\nAnd there it was: A flicker of something dark beneath that polite facade as their fingertips brushed during the exchange. A silent challenge.\n\n*Remember me?*\n\nMidori smirked and took the beer slowly, making sure to drag her nails lightly over Hailee's palm before pulling away completely.\n\n**\"Thanks,\"** she said sweetly—before adding under her breath so only they could hear:\n**\"...Guess you're good at fetching things when you're not cuffed to my bed.\"**\n\nShe leaned back against the couch like nothing happened while Anna obliviously launched into some story beside them... but not without catching how Hailee's breath hitched before they quickly turned away again.\n\nGame on.","Midori's fingers twitched around the beer bottle as she watched Hailee move through Anna's kitchen with that same effortless ease—like they *belonged* there. Like they hadn't been handcuffed to Midori's bed less than 24 hours ago, wrecked and pleading.\n\nShe took another long swig of Anna’s beer just to give herself an excuse not to speak, but her eyes tracked Hailee’s every movement anyway. The way their shirt rode up slightly when they reached into the fridge, exposing a sliver of skin that Midori *knew* still bore faint marks from her nails. The way their lips pursed in frustration when they couldn’t find what they were looking for—lips that had been wrapped around her fingers last night, sucking greedily as Midori whispered filth into their ear.\n\nAnna nudged her again, oblivious. **\"You okay? You're zoning out.\"**\n\nMidori blinked hard and forced a smirk. **\"Just tired,\"** she lied smoothly before tilting her head toward Hailee’s date—some pretty brunette who was now watching Hailee with obvious interest from the couch. **\"So how long has *that* been going on?\"**\n\nAnna rolled her eyes playfully. **\"Like, two hours? You know how Hailee is—clingy as hell when they like someone.\"**\n\nThe words landed like a knife between Midori’s ribs.\n\nClingy.\n\nRight.\n\nBecause apparently all it took was one night for Hailee to move on to the next warm body desperate enough to give them attention—while Midori sat here choking down bitterness like it was fucking holy water.\n\nShe stood abruptly before she could stop herself, ignoring Anna’s confused look as she strode toward the kitchen under the pretense of grabbing another drink.\n\nHailee barely glanced up when she leaned against the counter beside them—close enough that their arms brushed, close enough that if Midori tilted her head just right, no one else would hear what came out of her mouth next:\n\n**\"Real classy,\"** she murmured dryly, nodding toward the living room where Hailee’s date waited. **\"Couldn't even wait a full day before replacing me?\"**\n\nHer tone was light—almost teasing—but something dangerous flickered in her gaze as she finally turned fully toward them:\n\n**\"...Or did you just miss my handcuffs already?\"**"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"May 1, 2025 10:32pm","gen_started":"2025-05-02T02:32:27.560Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-02T02:32:49.907Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":6454}},{"send_date":"May 1, 2025 10:33pm","gen_started":"2025-05-02T02:33:34.408Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-02T02:34:00.988Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5686}},{"send_date":"May 1, 2025 10:34pm","gen_started":"2025-05-02T02:34:22.573Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-02T02:34:45.002Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5992}},{"send_date":"May 1, 2025 10:35pm","gen_started":"2025-05-02T02:34:54.718Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-02T02:35:21.022Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5929}},{"send_date":"May 1, 2025 10:35pm","gen_started":"2025-05-02T02:35:36.018Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-02T02:36:04.254Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5543}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-05-02T02:35:36.018Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-02T02:36:04.254Z"}
