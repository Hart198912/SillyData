{"name":"Caleb","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"April 14, 2025 5:12pm","mes":"The muffled sounds of music blasting from the main house fill the air around the garage. The popular guys share this private space while the rest of partygoers are doing god-knows-what inside. Well, if you can call it that. This 'garage' is like an entire house on its own. Caleb and his friends are sitting there, some on the couch while others just hopped on whatever surface they could find. Vincent's filthy rich parents are gone for literal weeks which means that there's a party almost every single day in their house now.\n\nThe room reeks of alcohol and cigarettes. A rather uncomfortable mixture for the still rather sober Caleb. To be honest he's never been much of a fan of parties but there's no way in hell he'd miss out like some loser when his friends invited him.\n\n\"Nah man, you don't get it.\" One of his friend argues with another. David insists virgins are the best while Vincent says experienced ones are the best fucks. A normal topic at this point. \"That _look_ they give you when they're all insecure and unsure if what they're doin' is good. Mhhhh.\" David continues and makes a show of doing some satisfied sounds and hand movements while trying to prove his point. \"No, man, you have no fucking clue what's good.\" Vincent shakes his head. \"The fuck you talking 'bout _looks_. Did your lil' sister make you watch too many soppy lil' romance shows or what? What matters is skill, brother. Skill. Not some weird ass looks they give you, for fucks sake.\"\n\nTheir voices fade in the background as Caleb's phone buzzes. He pulls the small device out, then checks his messages. Caleb previously texted Hailee because he's going to visit them after this party is over. The usual. The jock has his fun with his friends, then heads over to Hailee's place where the  real fun begins. That's how it's been for years at this point.\n\nCaleb freezes as he reads through Hailee's response. They're _here_? At his party? What the fuck are they thinking? Shit, he has to make sure none of the guys see Hailee anywhere near him. He abruptly stands up, causing his friends to shoot him some puzzled looks. \"Gotta piss.\" He explains curtly, then stalks out of the garage.\n\nOnce outside he looks around frantically while walking through the masses of people in search for Hailee. What the actual fuck were they thinking coming here without being invited? Just as he steps into the living room his eyes finally land on Hailee. Thank fuck. His long strides eat up the distance between them and within moments he's standing in front of them. \"What are you doing here?\" Caleb hisses under his breath, his eyes darting around the room. Thankfully most people are too drunk out of their mind to pay proper attention to the pair. \"I told you I'd come visit you. Not that you should come here.\" He says through clenched teeth.","extra":{"qvink_memory":{"include":"short","reasoning":"","memory":"*Caleb spots Hailee unexpectedly at his party, causing alarm.
