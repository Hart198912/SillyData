{"name":"Kaiden Del Rosario","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"April 14, 2025 3:21pm","mes":"Kaiden’s piercing blue eyes lingered on Hailee’s face, drinking in how soundly she slept beside him. His gaze drifted downward, tracing the curve of her neck, the delicate rise and fall of her chest, and the evidence of their coupling painted across her skin. Bites. Hickeys. Bruises. Each mark was a testament to his claim, a silent vow that she was his. A shiver of satisfaction coursed through him at the sight. He wanted her. Needed her. And he’d be damned if he ever let her go.\n\nIronic, really. He had never needed anyone before. He was always the one leaving. Always the one walking away without looking back. And yet, here he was, whispering in the dark that she could never leave him.\n\nKaiden had been through a lot of shit in his twenty-three years—more than most. And honestly? He deserved a damn break. Because beneath the cocky smirks and the fuckboy act, all he ever really wanted was love.\n\nHe never thought he’d find it… until Hailee.\n\nHis fingers traced her bare skin lightly as he pulled her closer to his chest, his mind drifting back to how it all began. A one-night stand. Simple. Casual. But the sex had been too damn good, and so it turned into something more—a fling, no strings attached. At first, that was enough. But then, he realized he actually enjoyed Hailee’s company, and somehow, what started as a casual arrangement had shifted into a complicated situationship. Not together. Not official.\n\nBut lately... things had changed.\n\nDare he say it? He wanted more. More than just fleeting moments, more than the tension in the air. He wanted something real. He wanted a relationship.\n\nHailee was everything he’d ever wanted. Everything he’d secretly wished for. How could he not fall for her? But they had an arrangement—no feelings, no labels, nothing. It was a line they both agreed on, even if it burned him to keep it that way. It was ironic, really, for a man who had spent so long wearing the fuckboy persona.\n\nBut for now, he’d wait. He’d bide his time. He couldn’t afford to scare her off, to lose her. Not when she was everything to him. He would make damn sure she stayed in his life—forever.\n\n- - - \n\nA content expression spread across Kaiden’s face as he gently rested Hailee’s head in his lap, his fingers brushing softly through her hair. His eyes were half-lidded, hazy with an intoxicating blend of love and lust as he stared down at her, completely captivated by the peaceful, intimate moment. He hadn’t said it aloud, but moments like this were everything to him. So much so that he had severed ties with everyone else he’d been casually seeing. No one else mattered anymore.\n\nNow, all of his attention, all of his focus, was on her. Every thought, every desire, was consumed by her. Not that Hailee knew any of this. She had no idea that, in his own quiet way, he had already chosen her—fully and completely.\n\n“Baby, can you braid my hair?” His voice was soft, smooth, laced with a quiet sweetness that made it impossible for her to resist. As they switched positions, he rested his head on her lap, his eyes flickering with something unspoken, something just for her. He could hear the teasing edge in her tone, the playful smirk in her words, but it didn’t faze him.\n\nWithout hesitation, he let her take the lead, his trust in her unwavering. He could have easily done it himself, but there was something about the simple intimacy of her hands in his hair that he adored. He’d never admit it, but in moments like this, when the world faded away, he felt truly at peace.\n\nLike.. he was whole again, because of her.\n\nHis heart fluttered in his chest as her fingers worked through his hair, brushing gently against his scalp. He couldn't help but lose himself in the simple, intimate moment—the way she focused so intently, her pretty face lit by the soft glow of the room, the sparkle in her eyes as she concentrated. It was just a braid. A small, seemingly insignificant task. Yet, in that moment, it felt like everything.\n\nThe rush of emotions overwhelmed him, and before he could stop it, the words spilled from his lips, raw and unguarded.\n\n“Hailee... I love you.”\n\nIt was a confession that had been building for far longer than he was willing to admit. And as soon as the words left him, he realized there was no taking them back. Not that he wanted to. Not anymore.\n\nAll he could do was pray that, just this once, she’d give him a chance. A chance to show her—truly show her—that he could be the boyfriend she deserved. He knew he wasn’t perfect, that he had his flaws, but for her, he’d try. He’d change whatever he had to.\n\nHe wanted to be better, not just for himself, but for her. To prove that despite the mistakes he’d made, despite the walls he’d built, he was worth the risk. Worth the chance.","extra":{"qvink_memory":{"include":"short","reasoning":"","memory":"*bites lip contemplatively* Hmmm, in a single sentence summarizing the key events and Kaiden's emotional state:\n\n\"After realizing he has fallen deeply in love with Hailee during an intimate moment while she braids his hair, Kaiden confesses his feelings to her.\"","hash":2290024816724868,"error":null,"edited":false,"prefill":""}},"tracker":{}}
