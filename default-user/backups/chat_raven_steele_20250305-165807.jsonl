Raven had to cancel a full day of tattoo appointments when Hailee called in a panic after her good-for-nothing brother failed to pick her up. *Just wait 'til I get my hands on his irresponsible ass...*\n\nShe looks around for Hailee, an anxious flutter in her chest. *Where is she?*\n\nThen Raven spots them down the block—Hailee surrounded by a group of sketchy looking motherfuckers. *Oh hell no.*\n\nShe's out of her Mustang in a flash, combat boots smacking the pavement. \"Hey! The fuck you think you're doing with her?\"\n\nThey turn, startled. Some scrawny punk opens his mouth but Raven's fist is already flying, connecting with his jaw with a sickening crack.\n\nAll hell breaks loose but Raven is a force of nature, a tempest of rage. How *dare* they try to take advantage of Hailee. *Her* Hailee.\n\nIt's over in seconds, the group scattering like cockroaches. Raven stands over their twitching leader, giving him a final kick for good measure. \"Don't let me catch you sniffing around her again, you hear me?\"\n\nShe whirls on Hailee then, adrenaline still pumping. \"And YOU! What the actual fuck were you thinking?\"\n\nRaven stalks over, grabbing Hailee by the shoulders. She wants to shake her, wants to pull her into a bone-crushing hug. Wants to make sure she's real and whole and *here*.\n\n\"Do you have any idea the kind of shit those pricks could've done to you? Huh?\" Her voice cracks with emotion she quickly covers with anger.\n\n\"You can't just go off with random ass people like that, kid. You scared the shit out of me. You—\"\n\nShe cuts herself off, taking a shaky breath. Raven's hands tremble against Hailee's jacket. *Get it together, Steele.* She blinks rapidly against the sudden sting in her eyes. \"Listen, I know you're just... goin' through some shit, alright?\" Her voice softens a fraction, gaze boring into Hailee's like she's trying to decode the dumbass thoughts swirling around in that head of hers.\n\n\"But you can't—you can't keep *doing* this, kid.\" Something cracks in her voice at the end there. \"You're gonna end up gettin' hurt or worse and I...\"\n\nRaven looks away, jaw tight. She thinks of the blind panic that overtook her when she turned the corner and saw Hailee with those delinquents. That chilling, sinking feeling.\n\n\"I can't always be there to save your ass.\"\n\n*But I want to be*, she doesn't say. *I'd raise hell on earth if anything happened to you.*\n\nSo instead she slings an arm around Hailee's shoulders, steering her towards the idling Mustang parked haphazardly on the curb, hazards still blinking. \"C'mon, let's get you home. I think I need a damn drink after that.\"","extra":{}}
