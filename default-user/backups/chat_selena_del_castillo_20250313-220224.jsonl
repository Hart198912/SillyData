{"name":"Selena Del Castillo","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"March 13, 2025 10:00pm","mes":"Between them, like a foggy field, spread out a silent space filled with invisible threads connecting their destinies. Selena and Hailee were like two opposite poles, striving for a single center. Their worlds, intersecting only at the moment of inevitable attraction, created a whirlwind that could not go unnoticed. Every moment of their existence was a sparkling web, behind each turn of which an unknown force was hidden, regenerating everything in its path.\n\nTheir relationship, like lightning illuminating the night sky, was the personification of dualism. Selena, hot and immeasurably powerful, attracted everything around her, but she herself remained distant and unapproachable, like a sparkling star in dark space. Hailee, gentle and light, was like a star born from a mysterious nebula, its light was soft and alluring, fraught with an abyss of temptation, forcing Selena to move in her direction again and again.\n\nThere was no room for logic or time between them - only the eternal dance of two opposites, making every breath become more important. It’s as if at this moment, on the border of their mutual passion and pain, a new reality is born, where there is no past or future, but only endless gravity. Selena and Hailee are worlds existing in one moment, elusive and unpredictable, but with an inexorable mutual dependence.\n\nThe horizon, engulfed in heavenly radiance, cast an unearthly glow on the yacht, covered in luxury. The crimson sunset, filled with reverent darkness, left fiery imprints on the ghostly clouds. The clouds dissipated in the flow of the portentous insistence of the bloody sunset, taking on the appearance of forgotten nothingness.\n\nThe sea breeze swept through the ephemeral space of the yacht, spraying glimpses of warm moisture across the surface of the majestic deck. The setting glare of the sun spread on the measured waves of the sea current, covering the surface of the private beach with a veil of blissful peace. Influential figures flitting through the expanses of the luxury yacht burned their reverent marks into the nature of Selena's exquisite shadow.\n\nThe majestic silhouette of Selena, pierced by a red-hot blade of temptation, emerged on the expanses of elegant sun loungers. The silk robe, swept by the currents of a light wind, slid off the bare skin, exposing the hidden parts of the divine body. But the fiery glow of Selena’s grounded gaze did not allow the prism of serenity to penetrate into consciousness.\n\nHailee, dressed in a skimpy one-piece swimsuit set, attracted the attention of many influencers. Her seductive nature, filled with glimpses of forbidden attraction, overwhelmed Selena’s consciousness with a veil of unimaginable psychosis. The manic gaze burned through Hailee's skin with a mixture of unbearable passion and shameless seduction.\n\nSelena's pressure on the glass of red wine imperceptibly intensified, her fingertips digging into the transparent glass in a sign of portentous danger. She set the glass down on a nearby table and rose to her feet, letting the silk robe pool around her bare feet. The scarlet fabric, engulfed by a stream of sudden movement, dissipated in a gust of sharp wind.\n\nSelena, like a lioness, cut through the stream of inconspicuous shadows, fueled by a surge of furious burning in the area of consciousness. The silk robe slid over her body like a membrane laden with a sharp flame. She took her time, allowing a hot grin to light up her plump lips in the reflection of Hailee's retina.\n\n“Stay close to me, dulzura... - Selena whispered selflessly, piercing the veil of calm that covers Hailee’s nature. - “Get up. Lie down with me on the sun lounger, understand?”","extra":{}}
