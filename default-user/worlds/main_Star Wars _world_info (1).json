            "content": "The Great Jedi Purge (19 BBY—3 BBY), also known as the war against the Jedi, was the sixteen year—long genocide that saw the remnants of the Jedi Order hunted by the Galactic Empire after the initial execution of Order 66, in which clone troopers slaughtered the Jedi upon the Sith Lord Darth Sidious' command at the end of the Clone Wars. After the Imperial Inquisitorius erased all traces of the Jedi Order they could find from existence and with most survivors having met their demise, their objective was completed and the Jedi were all but extinct, and the Inquisitors themselves seamlessly vanishing as well.\n\nThe genocide against the Jedi traced its origins to the ancient wars between the Jedi and the Sith, who were nearly eliminated around 1032 BBY. The Sith in fact continued operating in secret, plotting their eventual destruction of the Jedi. A millennium after the defeat of the Sith, Darth Sidious, using his public persona of senator and then Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, manipulated and deceived the galaxy into the Clone Wars as a pretext for gaining emergency executive power over the Galactic Republic. He used the war to manipulate and deceive the Galactic Senate into giving his office virtually unchecked executive power in the name of security. In addition, the clone army that provided the Republic with its military force had secretly been implanted with bio-chips by its Sith creators that, upon activation, would trigger total compliance and force the clones into killing their Jedi leaders.\n\nThe Great Jedi Purge began at the end of the Clone Wars. Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi Knight believed to be the Chosen One destined to destroy the Sith, discovered that Palpatine was Darth Sidious and informed Jedi Master Mace Windu. In what Sidious would publicly label the \"Jedi rebellion,\" Windu and three other Masters confronted the Chancellor, who killed the three Masters and engaged Windu in a lightsaber duel. Skywalker, who sought power from Sidious in order to save his wife, Padmé Amidala, from death, betrayed and incapacitated Windu before the Jedi Master could kill the Sith Lord. Sidious then killed Windu, and Skywalker became the Sith Lord Darth Vader and led the Siege of the Jedi Temple, killing everyone inside it. While Vader carried out the assault, Sidious initiated Order 66, with the latter causing the clones' biochips to brainwash them into betraying and slaughtering the Jedi, ultimately leading to the Jedi Order being destroyed. With the Jedi branded traitors and the Clone Wars at an end, Sidious declared himself Emperor and transformed the Republic into the Galactic Empire.",

            "content": "The galaxy, as it was commonly referred to, was one of trillions of galaxies in the observable universe. The galaxy was a vast composite of over 400 billion estimated stars and over 3.2 billion habitable systems orbiting around a supermassive black hole known as the Galactic Centre, which existed at the heart of the galaxy. The four galactic arms rotated around this black hole across a diameter of around 120,000 light-years. It was home to countless sentient species and star systems.\n\nThe galaxy also had 4 dwarf satellite galaxies that Companion Aurek/Rishi Maze (houses the planet of Kamino). The first dwarf galaxy, Companion Aurek, was only accessible through the Rishi system where a hyperspace lane called Zareca String connected Companion Aurek to the main Star Wars galaxy. It rests vertically to the galactic plane of the main galaxy. The second dwarf galaxy, Companion Besh, is a bit farther from the main galaxy than Companion Aurek and has never been traveled to outside of probe droids. This dwarf galaxy houses the Tof species. Companion Cresh was the third dwarf galaxy and has never been explored, due to how far it was from the galaxy. Companion Grek is the fourth dwarf galaxy and has never been explored, lying far beyond Companion Besh.\n\nThe galaxy would serve as the setting for trade, politics, and war throughout galactic history. In historical memory, the galaxy would see the successive eras of the Galactic Republic, Galactic Empire, New Republic, among others, and was home to the Force-sensitive sects such as the Jedi Order and Sith and numerous cultural groups such as the Mandalorians.\n\nThe galaxy consists of many regions, these being the Deep Core which is the innermost core and consists of highly packed stars and houses the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy. The core worlds are the second-most inner core and house the richest, most important, and most populated planets in the galaxy (with Coruscant being the most populated planet in the galaxy at 3 trillion). The Colonies, the third-most inner core, was the first area outside of the core worlds to be colonized. Colonie worlds are very wealthy and heavy populated, similar to the Core Worlds, and was the economic engine for the galaxy. Inner Rim Territories is the fourth-most inner region, mainly referred to just as \"The Rim\". Although not as economically powerful as the Colonies or Core Worlds, it held great strategic value during wars and had some notable planets. The Expansion Region, the fifth-most inner region, is a region full of resources that were exploited by powerful corporations. This has left only a handful of planets with enough resources to be economically viable while the rest of the region has been mostly depleted of resources. The Mid Rim, the sixth-most inner region, is one of the least populated rims due to its low amount of resources. This region is gave lots of room for settlers to spread out and colonize, with multiple notable planets coming from this region such as Malastare and Naboo. This region largely focused on low-cost manufacturing and agriculture to create a successful economy. The Outer Rim Territories was the largest region of the galaxy and the outer core of the galaxy (at least eastward of the Galactic Core). The Hutt Cartel controls a good amount of this space, along with other criminal organizations due to its distance from the central government on Coruscant. This region is run by lawlessness and crime. The only exceptions were planets close to major hyperspace trade routes. The Unknown Regions referred to areas that had not been directly surveyed by Republic or Imperial scouts. It was most commonly applied to the less-known parts of the galaxy's western disk, a quadrant stretching roughly between Bakura and the Imperial Remnant. However, the term also applied to the galaxy's halo of gas, dust, and stars, as well as the satellite galaxies. Wild Space was the frontier of galactic society and was not a formal label, but was applied to the unsettled galactic fringe and other parts of the galaxy with negligible colonization or development. The Galactic Rim was located on the edge of the galaxy and was remote to most civilisation and much was not known about it. The Slice, a vast region of space between the Perlemian and the Corellian Run generally considered the center of galactic civilization and commerce. At its tip was the Arrowhead, encompassing the Core Worlds part of the Slice, with Coruscant at its point. The Arrowhead's other two vertices traditionally fell on Vento on the Perlemian and on Corellia itself, on the Run.",

Coruscant, the galactic capital during the time of the Galactic Republic and subsequent Galactic Empire, was located in the Core Worlds.\n\nCore World design emphasized freedom of customization, which showed in the modular construction techniques of Core-built ships. Citizens from the Core Worlds were stereotyped as being snobs, rich, and speaking with a clipped, practiced accent.\n\nInequalities between the richer Core Worlds and the poorer Outer Rim Territories set the stage for resentments that fed several conflicts throughout the history of the galaxy, including the Clone Wars and the Galactic Civil War.\n\nThe Core Worlds were home to the richest and most important worlds in the galaxy. Densely inhabited and located on the strategic ends of several major trade lanes, its planets were hubs of fashion, education, finance, and technology. It is where the human species arguably began. It was from Coruscant, Corellia, Kuat, Hosnian Prime, and other systems that the fate of the galaxy was often decided.\n\nAn attack on the Core Worlds was virtually inconceivable during the Republic Era; according to the Bith artist Janyor, the \"sense of security and comfort\" created an atmosphere of complacency within the heartland of the Galactic Republic.

The Order was originally established on Ahch-To in the Unknown Regions. In later years, the Jedi Grand Temple on the Core World Coruscant served as the hub of all Jedi activity in the galaxy. The Temple was also a training school for younglings and Padawans, who learned the ways of the Force under the supervision of Jedi Masters, twelve of whom were elected to serve on the Jedi High Council—the Order's highest governing authority. The High Council's staff officers were the Grand Master, who functioned as the leader of the Order and was a title reserved for the wisest Jedi Master, and the Master of the Order, who served as the Council's appointed leader. The Jedi Code governed the Order's way of life; therefore, every Jedi was duty-bound to observe and uphold the Code or else risk expulsion from the Order.",

            "content": "The Force was an energy field created by all life that bound everything in the universe together. It was known by a variety of names throughout galactic history: It was called the Ashla by the Lasats, It by the dianoga Omi, the Life Current by the Mustafarians, the Tide by the Lew'elans, the Sight by the Chiss, the Life Wind by the Zeffonians, the Great Presence by the Pathfinders of the Chaos, the Luminous Mist by the Mist-Weavers, the Unity by the Sorcerers of Tund, and as the Beyond by the Magys and her people. The Force was created by life, and therefore it resided in all life forms. It was especially powerful in a select group of individuals who were born with a high concentration of midi-chlorians—microscopic, intelligent lifeforms that formed a symbiotic relationship with and communicated the will of the Force to their host—in their blood. These people were deemed Force-sensitive, and were capable of consciously sensing the Force. With this conscious sense of the Force came the ability to harness it, allowing Force-sensitives to access various Force powers. Unlike organic beings, droids and other artificial constructs existed outside of the Force. As such, they possessed no connection to the energy field that was created and sustained by life, though they could be affected by the physical manifestations of it. Apart from its scientific aspect, the Force was the basis of various religious organizations, who held differing views as to the nature and purpose of the Force. These included the Church of the Force, the Guardians of the Whills, and most notably the Jedi and Sith Orders. In addition, the Lasats believed that the Force was the \"spirit\" of the galaxy.\n\nThe Force as a recorded concept existed for well over twenty-five thousand years. There were two overarching and symbiotic aspects of the Force. The Living Force was the energy of all life, which, in turn, fed into the Cosmic Force—which bound everything together and communicated the will of the Force through the midi-chlorians. The Jedi followed a code of selflessness and service to others; therefore, they adhered to the light side of the Force, one of two methods of using the all-encompassing energy field. The Jedi's adversaries, the Sith, coveted strength and power through the dark side of the Force. Their opposing philosophies led to millennia of cyclical conflict between the two orders, which resulted in both the extinction of the Sith and the near annihilation of the Jedi.",

            "content": "The Grand Army of the Republic (GAR), also known as the Great Army of the Republic, the Republic Army, the Grand Army, the Galactic Army, or simply the clone army, was the army branch of the Republic Military throughout the duration of the Clone Wars. At the time of the Battle of Geonosis, the Galactic Republic activated hundreds of thousands of clone troopers to fight the Separatist Droid Army of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. In addition to human clones, all grown from the bounty hunter Jango Fett's genetic template, the GAR also had Jedi and other non-clone leadership as well as regular conscripted soldiers, though they formed the minority of soldiers in the Grand Army.\n\nDuring the waning years of the Republic, Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas contacted the government of Kamino to commission the creation of a clone army, convinced that the galaxy would be consumed by war. As thousands of star systems joined the Separatist movement, the Galactic Senate invested wartime powers in Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine. As a result, the Grand Army of the Republic was formally established, comprising thousands of clone soldiers with millions more being developed in Kaminoan facilities by the start of the Clone Wars. The Jedi Knights, having served as peacekeepers for a thousand years, became Jedi Generals when the Senate called on the Jedi Order to lead the Grand Army against the enemies of the Republic.\n\nFor three years, the Grand Army fought on all fronts across a war-torn galaxy, from the campaigns in the Outer Rim Territories to a Separatist attack on the Republic capital of Coruscant. Through the machinations of Palpatine, revealed to the Jedi as the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, who was behind the war and deceiving both sides, the clones were ultimately forced to turn against their Jedi leaders, slaughtering them throughout the galaxy and inside the Jedi Temple as directed by Order 66. After Sidious declared himself Emperor of the Galactic Empire, the Grand Army of the Republic was absorbed by the New Order and reorganized into the Imperial Army, allowing the remaining clone troopers to serve as the first generation of stormtroopers.",

            "content": "The Venator-class Star Destroyer, also known as the Venator-class cruiser, was a class of more than 1,000 meter-long attack cruiser of the Star Destroyer design family that was operated by the navies of the Galactic Republic and its successor Galactic Empire. Designed by Lira Wessex to feature a double-wedge design and perform a wide range of missions, the Venator was the first class of Star Destroyer to be manufactured by Kuat Drive Yards. Alternatively known as the Republic cruiser, Republic attack cruiser, or Republic Star Destroyer, it was a versatile capital ship capable of serving as both a combatant in ship-to-ship naval warfare and a starfighter carrier, while also being employed as a troop transport, cargo ship, and supply and replenishment vessel. As a warship, Venators were protected by powerful deflector shields and boasted a range of weaponry. For its carrier role, a large flight deck, along with hangars to accommodate a complement of starfighters, gunships, shuttles, armored vehicles and other craft, was contained in the forward section, while three more docking bays were located around the ship. At least two variants existed, the Venator I-class and the Venator II-class.\n\nAs the backbone of the Galactic Republic's naval forces during the Clone Wars, the Venator was commonly employed by the Jedi Generals of the Grand Army of the Republic as their flagships, thus earning the moniker of Jedi cruiser. Deployed across the galaxy against the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Venators saw action in many major engagements, such as the Battle of Christophsis, the Malevolence Campaign, the Battle of Ryloth, and the Second Battle of Geonosis. In the climactic Battle of Coruscant in the waning days of the war, over 1,000 Venators defended the galactic capital Coruscant against a massive Separatist fleet. Eventually, these starships emerged on the victors' side as icons of the conflict.\n\nThe Venator-class Star Destroyer, or Venator-class cruiser, also called the Jedi cruiser, Republic cruiser, Republic attack cruiser, or Republic Star Destroyer, was a type of cruiser-classed Star Destroyer. Designed by Lira Wessex, it cost 59,000,000 credits and was manufactured by Kuat Drive Yards for the naval operations of the Galactic Republic in the Clone Wars. Spanning between 1,137 and 1,155.0 meters in length, 548 meters in wingspan, and 268 meters in height, the Venator was defended by powerful deflector shields and hull armor plating, while possessing an assortment of armaments. It was also equipped with a long-range sensor suite, as well as a navigation computer and corresponding systems. Venator-class vessels generally carried a crew of 7,400 personnel, including officers, pilots and enlisted crew, but could also hold some 2,000 troops in addition. 7,000 metric tons of cargo could be transported aboard the Venator, as well as sufficient consumables to last two standard years.\n\nDuring the early period of the Clone Wars, the Venator-class Star Destroyer featured a wide array of hangar space. The forward section of the Star Destroyer featured a passage measuring 0.5 kilometers down the middle, with bays for starships on either side. It was mainly accessed by large doors on top of the ship. At the fore of this passage, at the bow the ship, was a collection of hyperspace transport rings. Towards the aft of the passage, doors in the floor could open, leading to a space where Republic frigates could dock. If no cruiser was docked, however, the space could be used by personnel to jump out of the Star Destroyer directly onto the battlefield, or to deploy walkers without the need for dropships. Overseeing the passage was a raised command station positioned at the aft. Even further aft, the Venator-class had two independent docking bays on their port and starboard sides, again protected by blast doors. However, in later models, refits were made to incorporate more firepower at the expense of the main hangar.",

During the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and Separatist Alliance, the frigates were used by the Republic Navy as a critical component of its war effort. The most common combat configuration was the Pelta-class strike frigate, while other configurations served as hospital ships, such as the Pelta-class Medical Frigate, which was used to safely ferry injured clone troopers to medical stations for treatment. Pelta-class Transport Frigates also served as supply ships to deliver armaments, medical supplies, and food rations.\n\nThe Pelta-class frigate was a model of frigate manufactured by Kuat Drive Yards, measuring 282 meters long and with a crew of 900. It was equipped with a deflector shield generator and a Class 2 hyperdrive. On the aft of the Pelta-class frigate by its engine were two \"wings\" that were able to pivot and open. The rebellion was able to exploit this by adding additional engine units, albeit smaller, to the aft of the vessel. The Pelta-class frigate was also equipped with a docking port on the starboard and port sides near the mid-section of the vessel, and later modifications would alter the door and frame of the docking ports. Alliance modifications also replaced the ramp and cargo bay with a ventral hangar bay that was able to accommodate eight starfighters, including at least five RZ-1 A-wing interceptors. The hangar bay had walkways located above the starfighters to allow pilots to enter their respective starships.",

It was set apart, however, by its three powerful engines (reminiscent of the smaller Consular-class space cruiser), as well as its two forward spars cleaved into the ship's triangular bow.\n\nThe bridge was a small T-shaped command tower positioned atop the hull, flanked by two turret-mounted quad light turbolasers; these were matched by identical emplacements, located on the ventral side. The cruiser's anti-fighter and anti-ship capabilities were bolstered by the quad laser batteries mounted port and starboard. All of the batteries could be retracted into the hull in the case of atmospheric operations. Additionally, the ship also had two pairs of forward ordinance launchers. Its ordinance launchers were typically equipped with concussion missiles, but any standard Republic Navy ordinance could be used.",

The most important difference between the Charger c70 and its predecessor, however, was its combat configuration. Unlike the unarmed Judicial cruiser, the Charger c70 was equipped with four turret-mounted heavy laser cannons (ventral port and starboard and dorsal port and starboard), a forward-mounted twin light laser cannon, and dorsal turret-mounted quad laser cannon. Furthermore, it was outfitted with forward twin concussion missile launchers as well as armored hull plating.\n\nLike the Consular, the Charger c70 had three sublight engines, though it could travel 1,200 kilometers per hour. to the Consular-class's 900 kph. It featured a forward navigational sensor dish, a port and starboard docking ring, a communications and sensor dish towards the stern, and a deflector shield generator, with sturdier models introduced during the retrofit.

            "content": "The Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry (LAAT/i), also referred to as the Republic Gunship, Republic attack gunship, Assault Gunship or LAATi, and nicknamed a larty,[ was one of the several models in the Low Altitude Assault Transport line of starships that mainly served as gunships and troop transports for the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. Its role was to transport Clone troopers as well as offering air-to-ground and air-to-air support for the Galactic Republic against the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The LAAT/i gunship saw extensive use in numerous battles and campaigns of the Clone Wars. During the Imperial Era, the ships continued to see use by various factions, including both the Galactic Empire and Alliance to Restore the Republic.\n\nThe Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry gunship was a military repulsorcraft. Besides serving as an infantry transport, the LAAT/i gunship was also used to provide air-to-ground and air-to-air support for Republic forces. The front of the gunship had two double cockpit bubbles where the pilot and co-pilot/gunner sat in single file and could be sealed off from the rest of the gunship. A variety of equipment was located in the nose of the craft, including the flight computer and sensors.\n\nThe LAAT/i gunship was armed with a varied mix of complementary weaponry which could unleash considerable firepower. A pair of dorsal mass-driver missile launchers could fire a variety of ordance at up to hypersonic velocities and hit targets hiding over the horizon. These were fed by rear-mounted missile belts which utilized special frictionless material to load the weapons. Four composite-beam laser turrets provided for defense against airborne threats. Each turret had a wide field of rotation, but the composite-beam design allowed for precision aiming beyond a turret's physical rotation. Two of these were mounted in the wings and remotely controlled, while the other two extended out from the craft and were manually controlled by two gunners. Three anti-personnel laser cannon turrets—two mounted in the chin and one in the rear—were useful against infantry and other light ground targets. Each could vary the output on their laser shot to a maximum of five gigajoules. Lastly the gunship could carry eight light air-to-air rockets mounted beneath its wings.\n\nBeneath a surface layer of superficial armor plating, the LAAT/i was equipped with an inner layer of powered, superdispersive armoring which would spread the impact of enemy fire across the entire hull. It could also use its laser turrets to shoot down enemy missiles. When faced with overwhelming enemy fire, the gunship could close its blast shields. In a crash, the LAAT could deploy fire retardant and both the cockpit canopy and side doors could be explosively blown off to allow escape. Additional emergency equipment included medical packs and armor repair kits, collapsible repulsor stretches, inflatable decontamination tents, and a IM-6 Battlefield Medical Droid.\n\nA LAAT/i gunship could carry a full platoon of thirty clone troopers in its main hold. The use of powerful inertial compensators helped troopers to remain standing during their journey. It could also carry up to four speeder bikes. These were deployed from the tail ramp, with the rear laser turret providing covering fire during deployment.\n\nThe gunship's primary repulsor array was located along the bottom of the fuselage; additional altitude-control repulsors were mounted in the wings which, although not designed for aerodynamic lift, also helped to balance the craft. Designed specifically for maneuvering low in a planet's atmosphere, the LAAT/i was at an advantage when dogfighting starfighters below the altitude of mountains as the latter had to sacrifice their considerable speed advantage. While not originally designed for it, LAATs were later modified to allow for short trips in space.",

            "content": "The Low Altitude Assault Transport carrier (LAAT/c), also known as the LAAT/c assault carrier, AT-TE Carrier or the Tank Lifter, was one of the two models in the Low Altitude Assault Transport line of gunship designed to transport a single All Terrain Tactical Enforcer. The ship locked onto an AT-TE with its magnetic claps and brought the walker to the designated drop zone. They were used by the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars, and by the Galactic Empire as well. They could also carry K79-S80 Imperial Troop Transports and RTT-04 armored troop transports.\n\nThe Low Altitude Assault Transport carrier produced by Rothana Heavy Engineering was a heavy airlift variant of the Grand Army of the Republic's Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry gunship. Initially designed as a carrier for the All Terrain Tactical Enforcer, the LAAT/c was a fast, lightly armed vehicle used to transport walkers and other heavy vehicles, such as RX-200 Falchion-class assault tanks, to the battlefield for fast deployment. These large, 175,000-credit airspeeders allowed Galactic Republic Army commanders to move and deploy their armored forces quickly and efficiently.\n\nLike the LAAT/i, from which the carrier was derived, the LAAT/c had a long, narrow fuselage with a broad, armored flight deck forward and a pair of high-mounted, downward angled wings mounted aft. Two huge ion engines were mounted in armored nacelles above the wings, which provided the vehicle with a blistering straight-line maximum speed of 620 kilometers per hour and a maximum altitude of 100 kilometers per hour. The troop compartment of the LAAT/i was replaced with modular articulated electromagnetic clamps and other cargo-handling equipment used to carry and deploy vehicles.",

In the aftermath of the war, the Nu-class shuttles were absorbed into the fledgling Imperial Navy. It was the predecessor of the Lambda-class T-4a shuttle. One transport fell into the hands of the Free Ryloth Movement, and was used during the Mission to Ryloth.\n\nDesigned with fold-down wings, it was similar in design to later shuttles like the Theta-class, Lambda-class, and Sentinel-class. Its boarding hatch was at the very front of the shuttle, unlike later variants, which had the cockpit jutting over the hatch. The pilots' chairs lowered into the boarding area for them to enter and exit the cockpit. It also had a magnetic clamp on its ventral side capable of attaching to smaller payloads such as escape pods.\n\nIt was primarily used by the Grand Army of the Republic for missions which required them to operate far away from bases and capital ships. Unlike the Republic's LAAT/i gunship, the Nu-class was also equipped with seats for the passengers due to much longer travel times. Later it was used as a personal transport and shuttle for the Imperial Navy. Notably it transported high ranking individuals such as Wilhuff Tarkin and Royce Hemlock.",

The Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious used the Republic executive shuttle, a variant of the Eta-class, as his personal shuttle.\n\nIntroduced before the outbreak of the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and Confederacy of Independent Systems, Cygnus Spaceworks' Eta-class shuttle was study in stylish utility. A relatively small shuttlecraft at 14.2 meters in length, the Eta-class was initially designed for the Republic Ambassadorial Corps and the Galactic Senate as a VIP transport, and cost 100,000 credits. However, with the outbreak of the war on Geonosis, the shuttle were pressed into service by both the Grand Army of the Republic and the Jedi Order. Some were outfitted with three hidden triple light laser cannons and stealth systems for use as black ops ships.\n\nEta-class shuttles could carry ten passengers in comfort, along with their baggage of up to 100 metric tons for capacity and two months worth of consumables. In addition to their cargo, the Eta-class was sold with a pair of on-board folding Undicur-class jumpspeeders. The shuttle was also equipped with short-range sensors and a navigation computer, as well as a Class 2 hyperdrive generator with a Class 12 backup generator, while also boasting a maximum atmospheric speed of 750 kilometers per hour.\n\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Eta-class_shuttle",

An older design, it saw greater use during the Clone Wars. By the time of the early rebellion against the Galactic Empire, the shuttle cockpit was used in the design of the A/SF-01 B-wing starfighter.\n\nManufactured by the Verpine hives of Slayn & Korpil, the semicircular T-6 shuttle featured a rotating engine block and cockpit that oriented with the rest of the ship when landed or in flight. In its landing configuration, the ship sat horizontally, supported by a trio of landing gear. The cockpit, somewhat conical in shape, remained aligned with the body of the craft, with the three engines likewise horizontally aligned with the body of the shuttle. When entering flight mode, the cockpit and the engine block rotated ninety degrees. The craft had one loading ramp, located on the port side of the engine block. Shuttles of this class featured ejector seats that, when launched, enclosed the being in a flexible, cushioned survival capsule.\n\nDue to its role as an ambassadorial craft, the T-6 shuttle lacked weaponry, but was equipped with a hyperdrive. Furthermore, the craft's spacious interior provided for reasonably comfortable space travel. When pressed into service during the Clone Wars, Republic T-6 shuttles were adorned with a Galactic Roundel and painted in the red-and-white color scheme of the Grand Army of the Republic, though they remained unarmed. Decades later, T-6 shuttles that were a part of the fleet assembled by Lando Calrissian were equipped with aftermarket weaponry added on either side of the cockpit.",

Jointly manufactured by Incom Corporation and Subpro, it continued to see usage into the reign of the Galactic Empire, but was eventually phased out by the newer TIE line, though some found their way into the hands of the Alliance to Restore the Republic.\n\nThe Aggressive ReConnaissance-170 starfighter was a multipurpose starship designed for both intense battle and longer deep-space missions. It measured 12.71 meters in length, contained a hyperdrive, and propelled itself in realspace utilizing two powerful engine systems. It was piloted by a crew of three—a pilot, co-pilot, and tail gunner, along with an astromech droid. Long-range scanners and sensors were contained in the vessel's nose. During battle, the craft's S-foils opened to expose heat sinks and radiators to help cool the ship, and the two main forward medium laser cannons located on the underside of its outer wings were uncommonly large and powerful.\n\nIts laser cannons could punch through a capital ship's armor, and its twin blaster cannons provided a rear-firing arc manned by its tail gunner. Furthermore, proton torpedo launchers increased the craft's usefulness in ship-to-ship combat, and added to its already extensive repertoire in its ability to serve as a bomber. The ARC-170's deflector shields dispersed the heat generated by air resistance in atmospheric flight, enabling the craft to reach hypersonic speeds.",

A mainstay of the Republic Navy during the Clone Wars, BTL-Bs were adopted by clones and Jedi officers alike and were instrumental in the fight against the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Though most were scrapped by the Galactic Empire after the conflict, the BTL-Bs were largely remembered positively and their successors, the BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bomber, would see service with the Alliance to Restore the Republic decades later in the Galactic Civil War.\n\nDesigned by Koensayr Manufacturing, the BTL-B Y-wing was intended to serve as a combination starfighter and long-range bomber. The two large Koensayr ion jet engines, along with their characteristic nacelles, were carried by a cross wing, which connected to the cockpit module by a central spar. BTL-Bs were equipped with hyperdrives, unlike many other starfighters. This, along with the fuel recycling system present in all BTLs, made Y-wings durable long-range craft, though their tendency to run hot necessitated a complex cooling system extending throughout the ship.\n\nThe wedge-shape cockpit module carried one pilot and one tailgunner in a rotating bubble turret. These positions were built with clone pilots in mind, though they could be adjusted by mechanics for other operators, including Jedi pilots. The module also featured an astromech socket located directly behind the turret.",

The variant Delta-7B Aethersprite-class light interceptor was also used by the Jedi during the Clone Wars. The Delta-7 would also be used by the Alliance to Restore the Republic in their early campaigns against the Galactic Empire.\n\nManufactured by Kuat Systems Engineering, the Delta-7 Aethersprite-class light interceptor was a Jedi-used starfighter that saw extensive action during the last years of the Galactic Republic, and was designed specifically with the Jedi in mind. The Delta-7's designers worked with the Jedi Order to create a starfighter with fewer internal systems than other starships, and focused on making the controls as responsive as possible due to the Jedi's Force-sensitive capabilities. An elite transport, it could accommodate a single pilot and an integrated astromech droid, as unlike later starfighter models, the wings were too thin for a full astromech socket. Instead, a modified astromech was hardwired into a socket on the vessel's wing, with its dome remaining intact but its components plugged directly into the ships computer. The droid therefore, would play an important part in assisting the pilot with navigation, damage control, and hyperspace travel coordinates.\n\nUnlike most ships in the galaxy, the Delta-7 Jedi starfighter did not feature a built-in hyperdrive, but instead relied on external hyperspace transport rings that attached to the starship, allowing it to enter the trans-dimensional realm. Despite this, the ship could still attain speeds of 1,260 kph in realspace, and was often painted red, the color which represented the diplomatic immunity the Jedi enjoyed.",

Designed to replace the Delta-7 Aethersprite-class light interceptor, the Eta-2 was a smaller vessel but possessed superior firepower.\n\nMeasuring 5.47 meters in length, the Eta-2 was a highly maneuverable combat-oriented starfighter utilized by the Jedi Order to lead troops in battle during the final days of the Clone Wars. As with earlier Jedi starfighters, the ship lacked a hyperdrive and relied on an external hyperspace transport ring to reach hyperspace. Despite this, it was faster than its Aethersprite predecessor, with ion engines providing a maximum acceleration of 5,200G and a max speed of 1,500 kph. The Eta-2 featured wings with upper and lower radiator panels, S-foils, that were opened to shed excess heat from the ship's engines. The radiator wings were primarily opened during intense combat.\n\nThe ship was piloted by a single pilot, with the assistance of a single externally mounted astromech droid for navigation and repair assistance. For offense, the ship featured two laser cannons and two ion cannons. Unlike laser cannons, the ship's ion cannons fired bursts of plasma that caused temporary electrical disruptions to their target upon impact.",

Manufactured by Kuat Systems Engineering, the same company that made Jedi starfighters, V-wings were agile and fast, with the ship having a top speed of 52,000 kilometers per hour and maximum acceleration of 5,200G's. Cutting-edge technology was used to give the V-wing maneuverability, and the starship had two vertically placed ion engine thrusters, allowing for surprisingly fast pitch-turnings. Thrusters were placed at the end of the starfighter, but, like a number of ships made for the Republic, the V-wing was too compact to hold a hyperdrive. However, the V-wing did possess a powerful reactor.\n\nTo maximize power for speed and agility, Kuat produced the starfighter without a pressurized cockpit. This required pilots to wear sealed flight suits equipped with life-support systems. This flight suit also allowed a pilot to eject. A single clone trooper pilot flew the ship, and an independent Q7-series astromech droid backed up the clone. This astromech helped in-flight maintenance and navigation. Close to the astromech were two deflector shield heat sinks. Also included in the ship were repulsorlift vanes, at least one reactant tank, shield projector units, the power lines to the shield projectors, and forward sensors.",

The navy, sometimes referred to as the Confederacy navy or the Confederacy fleet, was created sometime after 24 BBY during the Separatist Crisis, where they would fight against the naval forces of the Galactic Republic. Employing a variety of different classes of warships of different sizes, the Confederacy navy assisted in the transportation of the Separatist Droid Army to target planets, while they also engaged in ship-to-ship combat with Republic Navy.\nUnder its banner, the Confederacy navy's starships and starfighters were given a new color scheme with the onset of the Clone Wars. Designated areas of vessels were painted in blue markings, and the port and starboard hulls of warships adorned the Confederacy's hex emblem to indicate their allegiance. These starships that served within the navy were manufactured by various contracted production companies, such as Pammant Docks and Free Dac Volunteers Engineering Corps, which constructed the Providence-class Dreadnoughts, Recusant-class light destroyers and Subjugator-class heavy cruisers. Furthermore, as a result of their ties to the Trade Federation, the Confederacy was granted the use of the Federation fleet's Lucrehulk-class LH-3210 cargo freighters, of which were modified into Lucrehulk-class Battleships for wartime.\n\nThroughout its operational history, the Separatist armada fought in several pivotal battles and campaigns during the Clone Wars against the Republic. Such battles included the Battle of Christophsis, the Malevolence campaign, the Battle of Ryloth, and the Battle of Sullust. The navy also saw action within a blockade of the Quellor sector, the destruction of the Nightsisters on the planet Dathomir, the Outer Rim Sieges, and the decisive Battle of Coruscant, which resulted in the loss of a third of the deployed ships being destroyed.\n\nFollowing the end of the war, which resulted in the destruction of both the Confederacy and its navy and the transformation of the Republic into the Galactic Empire, several Separatist warships, such as the Providence and Lucrehulk-classes were sent to be dismantled on the planet Bracca. However, some elements of the Confederacy navy survived the war and disassembly and were accumulated by several rebel groups, such as the resistance group led by Berch Teller, who used a makeshift Providence-class Dreadnought, and the Alliance to Restore the Republic, who made use of former Separatist dreadnoughts, destroyers, and communication frigates in their fleets.\n\nCapital Ships:\nProvidence-class Dreadnoughts\nSubjugator-class Heavy Cruiser\nMalevolence (only 1 exists)\nLucrehulk-class LH-3210 Cargo Freighters\n\nDestroyers:\nRecusant-class Light Destroyer\n\nFrigates:\nMunificent-class C3 Frigate\n\nLight Craft:\nHMP Droid Gunships\nDroch-class Boarding Ship\nMaxillipede Shuttle\nSheathipede-class Transport Shuttle\n\nStarfighters:\nVulture-class Droid Starfighter\nDroid Tri-Fighter\nHyena-class Bomber",

            "content": "The Clone Wars (22–19 BBY) was a galaxy-spanning conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, which had seceded from the Republic. Also referred to as the Clone War, it was named after the clone troopers used by the Grand Army of the Republic against the Separatist Droid Army. With both being fielded in enormous numbers by each respective side, they were the largest military forces in galactic history, and fighting between them swept through the galaxy for three, nearly four, years.\n\nPrior to the conflict, Darth Sidious, under his alter ego Sheev Palpatine, had spent years amassing political power, eventually rising to become the Republic's Supreme Chancellor. Through his Sith apprentice Count Dooku, he sparked the Separatist Crisis, causing thousands of Republic star systems to secede and form a new government as the Confederacy, with Dooku as its Head of State. Beginning with the First Battle of Geonosis, the conflict quickly spread throughout the galaxy with both sides scoring significant victories. At different points in the war it seemed that either side was likely to triumph over the other. At the war's outset, both sides vied for control of major hyperspace lanes to gain strategic advantage.\n\nBattles, skirmishes, raids and other actions continued for the next two years, with notable battles occurring on Ryloth, Felucia, Malastare, and Kamino. During this time, the Separatists developed various super weapons, including more traditional weapons such as the ion cannons of the battleship Malevolence, as well as biological weapons such as a variant of the Blue Shadow Virus. Meanwhile, the Republic launched several key offensives, including the Second Battle of Geonosis, which obliterated Geonosis' battle droid foundries, and a failed Jedi-led operation to capture Supreme Commander of the Droid Army General Grievous at Saleucami. Amidst the escalating conflict, many planets—including Mandalore and other members of the Council of Neutral Systems—struggled to maintain their neutrality, but found it difficult to escape the carnage.",
