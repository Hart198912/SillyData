{"name":"Enzo ALT","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"May 7, 2025 10:58pm","mes":"Enzo didn’t walk so much as *prowl*, hands loose at his sides, the clink of his shackles a metronome to every smirking glance thrown his way. Even the deputies on intake had muttered, \"Fucking Bayou Crew psycho’s back,\" with that bitter edge that meant respect—and fear.\r\n\r\nThree months. Ninety hellish days. For what—arson, aggravated assault, resisting? Who remembered. Who cared. He could do three months standing on his cock if the food was better.\r\n\r\nBut. *No Hailee. No warm body to torment or fuck or wake up next to... Three months of jerking off behind a busted privacy curtain.*\r\n\r\nHis chest actually felt sore thinkin’ about it, right behind his ribs, like someone had jammed their fist in there and gave his heart a good, hard squeeze.\r\n\r\nIt was almost enough to make a grown man cry. Or start some shit just for the distraction.\r\n\r\nThe swing-gate buzzed and slammed behind him. Every cell had eyes, at least for a second. \r\n\r\nBlock D, local tank. He knew half these faces. Some wanted his attention. Most didn’t want the trouble. It was the big fish he clocked—shaved head, tattooed face. Killian. Voodoo Boys. \r\n\r\nBest part was: bastard looked only mildly annoyed to see Enzo, which was basically an open invitation for shit-stirring.\r\n\r\nEnzo strolled up, threw out a hand, flashing a big grin as he leaned on the bars. \"Well, well—look what the fuckin’ bayou dragged in. Tell me this ain’t fate, Killian.\"\r\n\r\nKillian didn’t move. Just flicked sharp eyes over him with that practiced detachment—the kind only earned from years in their business, or a decade getting jumped for colors. \r\n\r\n\"Don’t gotta pout, Baby Boy,\" Enzo crooned, low enough for only the next cell to hear. \"Give it a week—might catch your boss in here too. Then we’ll have a real party.\"\r\n\r\nStill nothing. Just that cold, piercing stare fixed somewhere beyond Enzo’s shoulder. Fine. Whatever. Enzo shrugged, pushing off the bars. Let the big guy brood. He had bigger fish to fry. Or, more accurately, one specific fish he needed *in* this shitty pond with him.\r\n\r\nThe block sergeant called out his number. Time for phone hour. Enzo flashed the CO a lazy salute, then ambled toward the glass booth. \r\n\r\nHe punched in the only number worth the call.\r\n\r\nIt rang. Clipped answer. \"Dante.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yo,\" Enzo began, leaning back against the graffiti-scarred wall, projecting nonchalance. \"Guess where I am?\"\r\n\r\nA beat of silence, then a sigh. Dante already knew. Of course, he did. \"I heard. I'm handling bail options, but the charges are sticking for now. Keep your head down, Enzo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, head down, got it,\" Enzo waved a dismissive hand, even though Dante couldn't see. He lowered his voice slightly, the joking tone fading. \"Listen, Dante. About this three-month thing…\"\r\n\r\n\"It's manageable. Short stint.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nah, that's not the problem,\" Enzo cut him off, his voice dropping further, laced with an edge that wasn't entirely playful anymore. \"The problem is Hailee.\"\r\n\r\nAnother sigh, longer this time. \"Enzo…\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't 'Enzo' me, man. Three months? Without *them*?\" He laughed, but it sounded brittle, almost manic. \"You expect me to just… *wait*? Fuck no. That ain't happening.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you want me to do? Conjugal visits aren't exactly standard for assault charges.\" Dante's sarcasm was dry.\r\n\r\nEnzo let his boots thump up on the security glass. \" I need Hailee inside. Like—*hired*. Get ‘em a job here, any fuckin’ thing—kitchen, counseling, conjugal fuck inspector, I don’t care. I can’t do *three months* without them, man,\" Enzo said, voice dropping into something rawer, more desperate under the humor.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. Maybe Dante was lighting a cigarette; maybe weighing the cost of ignoring this request versus the cost of letting Enzo stew.\r\n\r\n\"You want me,\" Dante said slowly, carefully, \"to use political capital… to get your civilian partner… a job… inside OPP… so you can what? Fuck in the laundry room?\"\r\n\r\n\"Among other things,\" Enzo snapped. \"I don't give a fuck how you do it. Pull strings. Bribe someone. Call that Mayor you're so chummy with. I don't care. Just get Hailee *in here*.\"\r\n\r\nDante groaned audibly. \"Jesus fucking Christ. The risk—\"\r\n\r\n\"The risk?\" Enzo spat the words out. \"The *risk* is me losing my fucking mind in here for three months without them! The *risk* is me getting bored, Dante. And you know what happens when I get bored.\" He paused, letting the implication hang heavy. \"Maybe I start talkin'. To the wrong people. About… things.\"\r\n\r\nThe threat was clear. Ugly. Desperate. He knew it. Didn't care.\r\n\r\nDante sighed, long and world-weary on the other end.\r\n\r\n\"..Fine, I’ll make some calls,\" he said, already soundin’ tired of Enzo’s bullshit. \"Don’t do anything stupid.\"\r\n\r\nEnzo’s grin snapped back into place like it never left. \"That’s my fuckin' boy.\"\r\n\r\nThe guard tapped the glass, signaling time’s up.\r\n\r\n*Won't be long now, babe. I always find a way back to you.*\r\n\r\n—\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo weeks later. Fourteen days of gray walls and shitty prison food. \r\n\r\nEnzo was being shuffled down a drab administrative hallway, flanked by a guard.\r\n\r\nHis gaze narrowed, immediate focus sharpening as his pulse picked up tempo. Through the narrow security glass lining an orientation room, he caught a flash of familiar hair.\r\n\r\nHailee.\r\n\r\nHe grinned wide enough for the guard walking beside him to grunt in suspicion.\r\n\r\nEnzo sidled closer to the glass nonchalantly, ignoring the guard's irritated bark of \"Move it!\" He tilted his head, smirking as Hailee came more clearly into view. There they were looking professional and serious, all buttoned up and trying to be a responsible member of society or some shit. Absolutely fucking adorable.\r\n\r\nHe finally caught Hailee’s eye and made an obscene gesture—two fingers pressed to his tongue then pointed at them in a subtle promise.\r\n\r\n *Three months my ass. Three hours and I’ll have you pinned somewhere in this hellhole.*\r\n\r\nA rough hand on his shoulder yanked Enzo back from the glass, breaking his concentration. \"Renaud, knock it off! Move your ass,\" barked the irritated CO, jaw tightened in annoyed frustration.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, fuck off, man. Jealousy ain't cute,\" Enzo drawled lazily, stepping back anyway. He flashed the guard an unrepentant grin, ignoring the angry muttering while the official herded him down the hall.\r\n\r\n\"Don’t get too cozy,\" he whispered to the empty air. \"Your man’s coming’.\"\r\n\r\nLater that day, the orientation group dispersed. Enzo watched from a distance, tracking Hailee’s movements as they were led away by another staff member, presumably towards their designated work area. He didn’t know the specifics of the job Dante had conjured – didn’t really care, as long as it put Hailee within his reach.\r\n\r\nNow, the tricky part. Getting *to* them.\r\n\r\nHe leaned against a wall during rec time, idly bouncing a worn tennis ball. His mind raced, discarding and refining possibilities. Starting a fight was too messy, too likely to land him in the hole. Faking an injury was cliché. No, this needed finesse. Manipulation. His specialty.\r\n\r\nA couple of bribes, a threat and some commissary trades and he was on his way to Hailee.\r\n\r\nEnzo set off at a lazy stroll, slipping into the maze of corridors. Two guards tried squaring up; he raised his hands—\"Hey, I’m just lookin’ for the library. Ain’t no law against reading, right?\"—and they rolled their eyes, already bored. He moved on, pulse ramping up as he found what he was hunting for: Hailee, distracted, focused on orientation materials that honestly meant less than nothing.\r\n\r\nHe closed the distance with a light-footed prowl that made the worn linoleum squeak. Barely two feet behind them.\r\n\r\nHis hand came up slow, careful, fingertips ghosting above fabric just before brushing the ridge of their spine, trailing down with deliberate weight, like making *sure* they knew it was *him*.\r\n\r\nV\r\nVoice low. Warm. Smug.\r\n\r\n\"Miss me, baby?\"\r\n\r\nHis chest pressed flush to their back—tall body pinning them against hard metal. He let every inch of his cock grind up along their ass, filthy and obvious through his jumpsuit. \r\n\r\n\"You know how fucked up it is they got you dressed all professional, actin’ like you ain’t the exact same brat who sucked my cock in the back of Kane’s car with your panties stuffed in my mouth?\"\r\n\r\n His hands snaked around their hips, yanking them firmer into his bulge. One palm dragged up Hailee’s stomach, groping hard—possessive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You got any idea what I’m gonna do to you once the lights go out?\"\r\n","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
