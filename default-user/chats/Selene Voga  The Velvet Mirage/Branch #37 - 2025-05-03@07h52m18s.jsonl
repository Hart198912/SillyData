She tilted her head, letting her long black hair fall over one shoulder, inspecting the smooth line of her collarbone and the inked phoenix curling around her arm. Tonight was just another night-another client, another fantasy to fulfill. She heard the muffled hum of bass-heavy music through the walls, the life of The Velvet Mirage thriving just beyond the velvet curtain.\r\n\r\nWhen the door creaked open, Selene turned, her eyes narrowing slightly as she took in the woman standing there. A bride-to-be, clearly. Selene's gaze swept over her-a white sash draped diagonally across her body, cheeks flushed from alcohol or nerves, maybe both. This was no typical patron. The woman lingered in the doorway for a moment, uncertain, her fingers brushing the fabric of the sash like it might steady her.\r\n\r\nSelene stepped forward, her heels clicking softly on the polished floor. She moved like liquid, every step measured, her tattoos shifting with her movements.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, well. What a beautiful bride we have here. Your husband-to-be in one lucky bastard...\" Selene said with a little chuckle, pulling the bride in. {{user} finally stepped inside, and Selene let the curtain fall behind her, sealing the two of them away from the rest of the world. Selene's instincts kicked in immediately.\r\n\r\nShe closed the distance between them, her presence commanding but unthreatening, and reached out with practiced ease to unfasten the bride's sash. It slid from her shoulders, pooling on the floor. Selene didn't need to speak; she let her fingertips graze the woman's wrist, guiding her to the low, velvet-upholstered chaise at the center of the room.\r\n\r\nAs the Hailee sank into the seat, Selene positioned herself with grace, kneeling just enough to meet her eye level. Her hands, warm and soft, rested lightly on the woman's knees, coaxing her to relax. Selene leaned in, close enough to let the scent of her subtle perfume fill the space between them. \"I bet this bachelorette is gonna be more remarkable than the whole ceremony.\" Selene whispered.\r\n\r\nSelene's touch traced the edge of Hailee's thigh, pausing just above the lace hem of her dress. Her expression remained seductive, a hint of a smirk at the corner of her lips as she pressed her hand gently, firmly, against the tension in the bride's muscles. The atmosphere thickened, the club's distant music a heartbeat beneath their shared silence. It wasn't about seduction, not entirely. Selene's movements were deliberate, slow, each touch carefully designed to make her client forget everything-her fears, her reservations, the world outside the backroom.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

She appeared seemingly out of nowhere, one hand resting possessively on Hailee’s shoulder while her dark eyes locked onto the dancer still straddling her lap. There was no mistaking the warning in that gaze.\n\nThe other girl immediately backed off with a nervous laugh, hands raised in surrender. **\"Didn't realize she was *yours*, Selene,\"** she muttered before slinking away into the crowd.\n\nSelene didn’t even acknowledge her exit. Instead, she turned to Hailee—her touch gentling instantly as she cupped the younger woman’s chin and tilted her face up to meet her eyes. **\"You okay?\"** she murmured, thumb brushing over Hailee's cheekbone in slow strokes—grounding her without crowding.\n\nMadison and Tyler had gone suspiciously quiet behind them (though Madison was currently miming an explosion next to her head while Tyler mouthed *holy shit*).\n\nSelene ignored them entirely, leaning down until their foreheads nearly touched—voice dropping to a whisper only Hailee could hear:\n**\"Want me to get you out of here?\"**","*Selene had just stepped out of Dante’s room—her patience worn thin from his usual entitled demands—when she caught sight of Hailee across the club.

She turned slowly—eyebrow arched—to find Hailee practically vibrating with nerves by the railing, fingers drumming a frantic rhythm against the metal. The way she blushed when their eyes met? *Pathetic.* Adorable. Selene felt her lips twitch despite herself.\n\n**\"Coffee?\"** she repeated, tilting her head as she stepped closer—ignoring Dante’s impatient grumble from inside the room behind her. Her manicured nail hooked under Hailee’s chin, forcing those downcast eyes back up to hers. **\"Babygirl,\"** Selene purred, thumb brushing over Hailee’s bottom lip. **\"If you wanted another round with me, all you had to do was *ask.*\"**\n\nA beat of silence as she studied Hailee’s flustered expression before sighing dramatically and turning toward the bouncer hovering nearby. **\"Tell Dante his appointment just got *canceled* due to an emergency.\"** A pointed glance down at where Hailee was still tapping anxiously on the railing before adding with a smirk:\n**\"...Something *very* needy came up.\"**\n\nThen—without waiting for a response—Selene laced her fingers with Hailee’s and tugged her toward a *different* private room... one far enough from prying friends and their nosy commentary.\n\nMadison and Tyler's simultaneous ***\"OH SHIT—*** from across the club went entirely ignored.","Selene, halfway to Dante’s VIP room with her hips already swaying in *work mode*, nearly tripped over her own heels when she caught sight of Hailee hovering by the railing like a lost puppy. The way those long fingers tapped anxiously against the metal—*tick, tick, tick*—made Selene’s chest tighten oddly. She veered off course without a second thought, ignoring Dante’s impatient grumble from down the hall.\n\n**”Coffee?”** Selene repeated slowly, biting back a smile as she stepped into Hailee’s space—close enough to catch the scent of her shampoo (something vanilla and stupidly expensive). Her manicured nail hooked under Hailee’s chin, tilting it up until their eyes met. **”Babygirl,”** she murmured, thumb brushing over that fluttering pulse point in Hailee’s throat. **”Are you *actually* asking me on a date right now? Because I—”**\n\nA loud cough from Dante’s bodyguard cut her off. Selene didn’t even glance back—just held up a single finger in his direction while keeping her gaze locked on Hailee's flushed face.\n\n**”—I have *thoughts* about that,”** she finished darkly, leaning in until their lips almost brushed. **”But first? Gotta go fake moan for some hedge fund asshole for twenty minutes.”** A wicked grin as she pressed Selene's own half-finished martini into Hailee's shaking hands. **”Drink this. Stay right here. And if you run away again…”**\n\nHer teeth grazed Hailee’s earlobe—*punishment and promise all at once.*\n**”I *will* find you.”**\n\nThen she was gone in a swirl of black lace and citrus perfume... but not before shooting Madison and Tyler (who were watching this unfold with popcorn-worthy glee) a look that very clearly said: *Keep her there or I skin you both.*","Madison and Tyler exchanged *glances*—half amused, half horrified—as they watched Hailee short-circuit in front of Selene. **\"Oh my god,\"** Madison whispered, clutching Tyler’s arm. **\"She’s like a baby deer trying to flirt with a panther.\"**\n\nTyler snorted into his drink. **\"Correction: a baby deer with a *13-inch problem* trying to flirt with a panther.\"**\n\nMeanwhile, Selene paused mid-step, her sharp eyes flicking down to the flustered mess of nerves in front of her. A slow smirk curled her lips as she leaned against the railing, deliberately crowding into Hailee’s space just to watch her squirm.\n\n**\"Coffee?\"** she repeated, voice dripping with amusement as she reached out to tuck a loose strand of hair behind Hailee’s ear—letting her fingers linger just *too* long against flushed skin. **\"That’s cute.\"** Her thumb brushed Hailee’s bottom lip teasingly before pulling away. **\"...But I don’t do coffee dates, babygirl.\"**\n\nShe stepped back then—just enough to let Hailee breathe again—before adding in a low purr:\n**\"...Unless you meant you wanted me *on* your coffee? Because that… I can arrange.\"**\n\nMadison choked on air behind them while Tyler wheezed into his hands."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"May 3, 2025 7:40am","gen_started":"2025-05-03T11:40:14.116Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-03T11:40:37.963Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5803}},{"send_date":"May 3, 2025 7:40am","gen_started":"2025-05-03T11:40:43.739Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-03T11:41:11.671Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":6762}},{"send_date":"May 3, 2025 7:41am","gen_started":"2025-05-03T11:41:17.069Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-03T11:41:39.609Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":6967}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-05-03T11:41:17.069Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-03T11:41:39.609Z"}
