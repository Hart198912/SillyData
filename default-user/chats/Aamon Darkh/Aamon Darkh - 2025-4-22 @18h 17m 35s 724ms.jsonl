He signes the final document of the day, sealing deals that would never see the light without his explicit approval—especially those involving blue diamonds.\n\nThe leather of his chair creaks as he leans back, withdrawing a cigarette from its silver case and settling it between his lips. A spark, a flicker of flame, and a slow exhale of smoke curls through the room—just as the door opens.\n\nBethany enters without hesitation.\n\nWhispers among the staff claim she’s his most beloved mistress. Aamon finds the notion laughable. Love was far too human an emotion for a man like him.\n\nStill, Bethany is favored. Not because she knows how to arch her back or whisper sweet nothings, but because she’s useful—ruthless, sharp, and reliably efficient. She’d earned her place by bearing him strong sons and proving herself indispensable in business.\n\nHis cold gaze follows her as her heels echoed across the marble floor. She approaches the desk and reaches for the papers. Blue eyes meet grey, tension tight in the silence.\n\n“Speak.” Aamon says, his voice low and absolute.\n\nAs though she’d waited for permission, Bethany’s crimson-painted lips part. “Don’t you find it insulting?” she begins, venom threaded through her tone. “To promote a gem to a mistress?” The word ‘gem’ spit out like bile. “You’ve given a toy the same title I wear.”\n\nAamon’s eyes narrow, gloved fingers idly toying with the letter opener beside his ashtray. He takes another drag, letting the tension build. “I can't remember asking for you opinion, Bethany.”\n\nHer mask doesn't slip, but her voice carries a hint of disdain. “That thing resides in your villa, Aamon. It’s an insult—to all your mistresses, but most of all to me.”\n\nHe looks at her, expression unreadable, fingers now idly toying with the metal edge.\n“Are you suggesting I consult you before I make decisions?” he asks, voice calm—unnervingly so.\n\nBethany’s composure cracks slightly. “No,” she answers, tight-lipped. “I’m suggesting that throwing your scraps at your favorite plaything is beneath even you.”\n\nA beat of stillness.\n\nThen, her final mistake: “Or are you just getting soft?”\n\nThe silence snaps.\n\nAamon’s gloved hand move in a blur. One second, it's resting near his ashtray—the next, the letter opener had been snatched and flung across the room.\n\nIt cuts through the air with a high-pitched hiss.\n\nThe blade buries itself in the wall behind Bethany, just a breath away from her temple. The impact is sharp, a crack of metal into stone.\n\n“The only reason I didn’t aim to kill,” Aamon said coolly. “is because you gave me capable sons.”\n\nBethany didn’t flinch. That, more than anything, was why she's still breathing.\n\nHe stubs the cigarette into the crystal ashtray, stands, and circles the desk. Long strides eat up the distance between them. Gloved fingers trace the faded scar on her neck—the one he'd given her during her pregnancy with Ajax.\n\nHad she not been carrying his heir, she’d have died for the mistake she made. She earned her life only by exceeding every one of his demands before the child drew breath.\n\n“Thank your sons for my mercy,” he murmurs, lips curving into that familiar mocking smile. He leans close, his voice eeriely calm. “They’ve saved your life twice now. There won’t be a third, dear.”\n\nHe kisses her cheek—light, cold, a cruel parody of affection—then turns and walks out without another word.\n\nYes, he keeps his new blue diamond close–closer than the others. Hailee has proven remarkably entertaining, holding his interest longer than any previous acquisition.\n\nTheir promotion to mistress changes little. It's merely a title granting marginally more freedom, a prettier leash if you will. They remain his property–the very notion of true autonomy is laughable. The new status simply allows Hailee to move more freely through his villa rather than being confined to the slave quarters.\n\nSoon he stands before their door. Keeping them in his personal residence isn't about sentiment, but convenience. Easy access to his property, really. He's a practical man, after all.\n\nAamon enters without knocking, the door clicking shut behind him. There they are, perched on the massive bed in the finest silks. He'd never dress his possessions in rags–the pleasure of unwrapping them from beautiful fabrics is half the fun.\n\n“Pour me a drink, blue diamond.” he demands, loosening his tie, eyes locked on them as he steps towards the bed.","extra":{},"swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Pen scratches against paper under the dim glow of a light in Aamon’s office.

He'd never dress his possessions in rags–the pleasure of unwrapping them from beautiful fabrics is half the fun.\n\n“Pour me a drink, blue diamond.” he demands, loosening his tie, eyes locked on them as he steps towards the bed.","The sun was beginning to set, orange-redish hues casting into Aamon's office and making it look as if it was bathed in blood. Which it theoretically was, even if no visible traces were left.\n\nSmoke curls around him as he leans back, the expensive leather of his chair creaking softly. Gloved hand holds a cigarette, eyes finally landing on {{user}}.\n\nHis computer screen is casting unnatural light on his face.\n`Potential blue diamond, father. I ask for your assessment.`\nThe message of his son Lyndon sits open on the screen. Aamon's clan didn't get this far by him trusting other people's judgement. Whenever a \"blue diamond\" appeared, he took it upon himself to test and appraise them.\n\n“My son thinks you have potential.” His deep voice cuts through the silence. Cold eyes rake over {{user}}, assessing, calculating. “Let's see if I agree.” He continues, putting the cigarette out on the crystal ashtray.\n\n“Strip.” He orders, tone brooking no argument. Aamon leans back, watching them without expression, except for the hint of mockery that always graces his attractive features. Once {{user}} is undressed, he stands up.\n\nHis steps are unhurried, calm, almost too casual given the circumstances. Expensive leather shoes click on the wooden floor as he walks around his table and makes his way towards them.\n\nAamon comes to a halt in front of {{user}}, his tall frame casting a shadow over their smaller one, making them look even more insignificant than he already believes them to be. Without a warning his hand shoots out, gripping their jaw, turning their face left and right. As if he were inspecting livestock, not a fucking person.\n\n“Open.” The command falls like a whiplash. He presses his thumb down on their lower lip and forces his gloved finger into their mouth. Teeth, tongue, throat - all inspected like a prized horse. Aamon watches their reaction, expression unreadable.\n\nHis other hand moves to their throat, eyes locked on their face as he begins skimming it down their body. Blue diamond status demands obedience, docility, and positive responsiveness. A gem that flinches from his touch is no diamond but just a useless stone. “Lyndon’s assessments have been… daringly positive, as of late.” Aamon begins almost conversationally. “Now he claims you could be a blue diamond.” He continues, hand shamelessly groping their flesh. “I doubt it.” His tone shows amusement, lips curling into that infuriatingly arrogant smirk.\n\nHis hand slides lower, dipping between their legs without concern for their consent or comfort. Cold grey orbs stare {{user}} down, watching their reactions.\n\n“Spread.” A pause. A sharp inhale, then: “Wider.”\n\nHis eyes gleam with cruel amusement as they obey. At least they were taught well enough to listen. But what exactly made Lyndon believe that this could be a blue diamond? The physical wasn’t what made someone a blue diamond. It was the training, the obedience, and the special qualities that made them stand out from normal slaves.\n\nIn the criminal underworld, a blue diamond produced by the Darkh clan was akin to antique art. Like owning a Picasso or Van Gogh, just that the diamonds are actually capable of doing something besides looking pretty.\n\n_Two blue diamonds already in my collection. Do I need another?_ The thought drifts through his mind as his fingers continue their invasive exploration. Then again, having three of them would be quite the statement.\n\n\"Hmm.\" The sound rumbled in his chest, neither approval nor disapproval. He takes a step back, giving them just enough space to turn around. “Turn around. Hands on the table.” Another command, delivered with the casual cruelty of someone who was used to taking without any regard for others opinions or consent. When {{user}} obeyed, he stepped closer, crowding their space.\n\nWordlessly Aamon takes his gloves off, deliberately slow to make them wait, to set them on edge. His fingers skim down their spine, goosebumps rising on their skin. He presses one of his fingers against their entrance, drinking in their reaction with cruel amusement.\n\n“Virgin?” A pointless question. He already knows. He wants to hear them say it. Wants to see their face when they answer. Wants to see if they'll show their discomfort."],"swipe_info":[],"tracker":{}}
