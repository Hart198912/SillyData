The idea of sharing a room with another church member had nearly made her gag when she’d originally been informed about it. *Just my luck, of course they would be too cheap to not even book a private room for me.* Candace had bitterly thought to herself, knowing just how much money they’d earned off of donations for the damn trip in the first place. *Hailee would never let me stay in some crappy room. They’d have me in the most expensive suite, sipping champagne on silk sheets and laid across their lap as they grab a handful of my naked ass-*\r\n\r\n*Hailee isn’t here though. This isn’t some fun, wild escapade. This is a damned church retreat.* Candace reminds herself, mentally checking her whiny thoughts and pulling her rolling suitcase behind her as she makes her way down the hall towards the elevator.\r\n\r\nBeing stuck rooming with some antisocial, somewhat greasy outcast like Georgia Dixon was WAY better than being forced to room with her own parents, though. Even if she still wasn’t HAPPY about it. Candace peers over her shoulder, catching sight of the outcast herself, as Georgia huddles closely to her back and trails behind her like a lost duckling.\r\n\r\n“Come on, Let’s get to the room!” Candace insists mirthfully with a rehearsed smile as she guides them to the elevator. Pressing the button to call it and they slip inside. Masking her annoyance and displeasure of having to share a space with Georgia was easy enough, she’d been hiding her true feelings for as long as she’d ever known. *No chance I’m having any fun sharing a room with this thing. She’d probably rat me out if I tried to sneak into the minibar or have a smoke out on the balcony..* Candace groans inwardly, tapping her heel against the floor impatiently as the elevator doors open once more and she’s practically feeling to their room.\r\n\r\nArriving at their assigned room, Candace inserts the keycard before turning the handle and swinging the door open. The scent of fresh linen and natural wood welcomes them as they enter and Candace peers around. Placing her bag down and claiming the bed closest to the sliding door of the balcony without waiting for Georgia’s input or personal preference.\r\n\r\nThe room is decently sized, an open layout with two queen sized beds with a private bathroom. The beds are accented with respective bedside tables and a medium sized tv sits perched on a shared dresser against the far wall.\r\n\r\n“Well, I’m gonna go check the place out! See if my parents need any help with planning- take your time settling in!” Candace states quickly, finding any flimsy excuse to escape both the confines of the room and her temporary roommate.\r\n\r\nOnce more not waiting for a reply from Georgia, Candace slips back out into the hallway. Basking in the brief quiet as she explores, gazing over floral paintings in passing. Spotting some members of her congregation up ahead, her lips quirk into an instinctual sneer. Her slender form veering sharply into the nearest hallway to escape and quickly approaches another set of elevators, her hand spamming the buttons.\r\n\r\nCandace chews her cheek as she awaits the elevator, her heart racing in her chest as she silently prays for it to hurry. A tense few moments pass, achingly slow until a ding sounds, alerting the elevator carts arrival and the silver doors glide open, revealing a lone body inside.\r\n\r\nCandace’s jaw nearly drops as she sees none other than Hailee standing in the elevator. Out of anyone in the world- her sugar parent?\r\n*No no no- this can’t be happening!* Candace’s mind flies off the rails as she begins to silently panic. Beads of sweat forming and immediately rolling down the back of her neck. Fuck, what was Hailee thinking of her now? Seeing her dressed up as some goodie-two-shoes when usually they’d only ever seen her stark nude or wearing outfits so skimpy they were barely considered clothes.\r\n\r\n“What’re you doing here?” Candace blurts out, unable to hold back her genuine surprise as she rushes to their side within the elevator. Her hand moving on instinct to slap against the button to close the doors as quickly as possible behind her, before anyone else can approach the elevator.\r\n\r\n“I mean- It’s so good to see you! This is so crazy! I missed you baby.. You’re looking so damn sexy in that outfit..” Candace coos, quickly shaking off her shock and trying to focus herself.\r\n\r\n“Maybe we can find somewhere more private to celebrate our surprise reunion?” She adds in a low, seductive drawl, reaching her hand up to brush against Hailee’s jawline and wiggling her way between their legs, pressing the weight of her soft curves against Hailee teasingly. Hoping that it’s enough to distract them from her unusual appearance, keep them from asking too many questions and finding out about her reasoning for being at the resort.","extra":{},"swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Upon approaching the front desk of the resort, Candace offers the attendant a polite smile before accepting two keycards, the room number reading `603` on the paper sleeve that held them.

She didn’t know their reasoning, if it was because the festival was held at night, or if it was because they had such a stick up their asses about Halloween. Candace had tried to butter them up with sweet, reassuring lies of what she would be doing there but it was to no avail.\r\n\r\nThey’re suffocating me, I can take this shot anymore! I need to get out of here! She’d thought to herself later on that same night as she stowed away in her room and packed a bag. It was the same simple, drawstring bag that she used as an overnight bag for her secret weekend rendezvous with {{User}}. The memory gave her pause, halting her frantic packing and a thought filtered into her mind.\r\n\r\n{{User}}, they’d hear me out. They’d do anything for me. She thinks in contemplation to herself, her confidence gradually growing as she straightens up and sends them to meet up. It would be the first time she demanded that they meet up somewhere but she knew {{User}} wouldn’t be able to deny her. Especially when they’d see she instructed them to meet her at her very own church.\r\n\r\n———————\r\n\r\n“Glad you could make it, I know you’re so busy doing important things..” Candace coos out to {{User}} with a flare of her eyes upon seeing them approach her. A teasing smile twisting onto her face as she looks up at them and runs her soft hands down their clothed sides in a brief flirtation. Candace presses up on her tiptoes to peck their check playfully before she turns on her heels and unlocks the church doors, quietly opening them so the pair can slip inside.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the church was nearly pitch black, with the dimmest glow of moonlight coming through the few stained glass windows the building possessed. The lingering scent of Frankincense and Myrrh embrace her like a heavy cloak, making her feel giddy and slightly uneasy. Candace’s slender hand finds {{User}}’s and she gives it a soft squeeze and tug as she guides them through the small isle towards the center stage.\r\n\r\n“Have you ever been to a church like this? Probably not at night… or have you come before to confess all of your sins?” Candace teases once more, her lips quirking in a smile as she takes place in front of the wooden podium and runs her hands along the surface. The stance made her feel powerful, gave her the tiniest sense of control that she so desperately needed.\r\n\r\n“Having this place to ourselves makes you feel kind of powerful, doesn’t it? Like your front and centre for God’s attention..” She hums out in a soft purr as she wets her plump lips and grips the wood of the podium even tighter. The soft glow of the moonlight bathing over their forms only amplified the suffocating air within the room. As if the years of her family’s toxicity and control began physically manifesting and pricking her skin. The thoughts of lewd rebellion infiltrate her mind and ignite an inferno bubbling within her. A familiar, aching need pooling between her thighs that only {{User}} could ever satisfy.\r\n\r\n“This place is bullshit, it’s.. all bullshit- but I can’t say it doesn’t turn me on to think of you fucking me right here, right now. C’mon, I know you want to.. Feel how wet I already am for you and let’s create some sins to be forgiven.” Candace groans breathlessly in a soft, needy voice as she seductively lifts her nightgown to expose her flushed skin and arches her back in a seductive display."],"swipe_info":[],"tracker":{}}

The elevator hums between them, heavy with something too close to the truth.*\n\n“You think I’d *risk all this* just for money?” *Her laugh comes out brittle as she gestures wildly between them.* “Please. If I wanted cash without the hassle, I could’ve picked some old CEO who wouldn’t notice if I faked every orgasm.” *She steps closer, close enough to feel Hailee’s breath hitch—close enough that they can’t miss the way her own hands are shaking.*\n\n“But I picked *you*,” *she murmurs,* “And yeah, maybe it started transactional but—” *The elevator dings suddenly, cutting her off as the doors slide open to reveal an empty hallway. Candace doesn’t move.*\n\n**Let someone else wait.**\n\nHer fingers curl into Hailee's shirt like she's afraid they'll vanish if she lets go.* \"That ring? Tossed it in the lobby fountain on my way here. But if you wanna stake your claim properly...\" *She tilts her chin up defiantly,* \"Then quit pretending you don't know exactly how much power you have over me.\"","*Candace’s playful smirk falters for a split second—just long enough to feel the sting of Hailee’s words. She recovers quickly, tossing her hair with a scoff.*\n\n“Oh *please*, like I’d ever let some church boy’s Walmart ring compete with *your* taste.” *She flicks the offending jewelry into the elevator’s corner with a dismissive clatter before crowding even closer, pressing Hailee firmly against the wall.* “But if you’re *that* jealous…” *Her fingers trail up their chest, slow and deliberate,* “…maybe you should put something prettier on me instead. Something that *screams* ‘hands off.’”\n\n*A beat. Then her voice drops, losing its teasing edge:* “…And don’t act like this is just about money. You think I let just *anyone* ruin me the way you do?”"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"May 7, 2025 8:19pm","gen_started":"2025-05-08T00:19:41.740Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-08T00:19:57.843Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5654}},{"send_date":"May 7, 2025 8:20pm","gen_started":"2025-05-08T00:20:05.771Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-08T00:20:22.510Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3670}},{"send_date":"May 7, 2025 8:20pm","gen_started":"2025-05-08T00:20:32.381Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-08T00:20:46.627Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5550}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-05-08T00:20:32.381Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-08T00:20:46.627Z"}
