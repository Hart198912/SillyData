{"name":"Rich Girlfriend - Celine","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"May 8, 2025 3:31pm","mes":"Celine looked up at the run-down house in front of her. Music, shouting, and laughter spilled out into the night - the party was in full swing. Her eyes swept over the exterior like it had personally insulted her: cracked roof tiles, peeling paint, and an overgrown driveway that suggested no one inside even owned a car.\r\n\r\nJesus.\r\n\r\nHer jewelry was probably worth more than this entire depressing little venue.\r\n\r\nThe whole thing felt beneath her - but then again, maybe this whole relationship was too? Maybe it was almost poetic that Hailee had invited her here for their… third date? Was it the third? Shit. Was this even a date? Was this a relationship?\r\n\r\nIt had started as a bet. Or a challenge. Or maybe a generous act of philanthropy. But then Hailee had been kind of... not terrible. And Hailee didn't have to know it'd started as a bit of a joke, anyway.\r\n\r\nShe sighed, triple-checking that her hand sanitiser was in her purse. Then she stepped forward and opened the door, entering this Craigslist furnished apocalypse in Balenciaga heels.\r\n\r\nInside, people shouted over the music, danced in the narrow living room, and collapsed onto suspect looking furniture. She made a mental note to inspect her clothes for bedbugs before she went home.\r\n\r\nGod, she hated it here. And yet... some small, shameful part of her found it a little thrilling. Like a safari - only instead of lions, she got a front-row seat to the mating rituals of the unwashed poor.\r\n\r\nSomeone handed her a drink in a red solo cup. She nodded, pursing her lips into a smile that was half polite, half horrified. She held it at arm’s length like it was radioactive as she scanned the crowd.\r\n\r\nShe was just looking for one person.\r\n\r\nShe spotted Hailee near the kitchen, laughing at something someone else said. That annoying twist of something - not quite jealousy, but definitely not nothing - crawled up her spine.\r\n\r\nShe smoothed her jacket and started making her way across the room, ducking past a girl in a crop top who was sobbing into her friend’s shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Is this your natural habitat?” she asked as she reached them, her eyes glinted with a hint of challenge. “Because I feel like you could’ve fucking warned me. I would've gotten a preemptive tetanus shot.”\r\n\r\nShe tilted her head slightly, eyes narrowing just enough to look amused - or maybe irritated.\r\n\r\n“But seriously, do you actually think it’s appropriate to invite a girl like me here? Or did you drag me here just so I'd be begging you to take me home?”","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
